Changes in forest structure with elevation cause ...

# Abstract

# Overview
* Introduction
	* Tropical trees are shifting upslope and will encounter changes in environment as they do
	* It is important to predict movement because...
		* Conservation priorities
		* Carbon sequestration
		* Ecosystem service provision
	* The majority of models don't do it very well, often over-estimate the rate of upslope migration
	* This might be because they don't include things that vary with elevation like forest structure- LiDAR paper
	* Previous studies have suggested that species could be limited by changes in biotic environment
	* Seedlings are particularly sensitive to changes in environment and represent a stumbling block for the establishment of a plant
	* Seedlings experiencing higher levels of stress are less likely to survive to be able to recruit new individuals
	* Seedlings can also show acclimation to environment by changing their morphology
	* Hypotheses:
		* 

* Materials and Methods
	* Study site
	* Species
	* Physiology
	* Morphology
	* Forest structure
	* Statistical analysis (cut this down compared to diss.)
	
* Results
	* A decrease in canopy cover with elevation causes an increase in plant stress (Fv/Fm)
	
* Discussion
	* Recap of key results
		* 

* Acknowledgements

* Supplementary information
	* Model selection process
	* Rank abundance curve (Is this proprietary data?)
