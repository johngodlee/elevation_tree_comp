Caveats

**Rare Species and Ecosystem Functioning **

**Lyons *et al.* 2005**

-   The majority of studies demonstrate that conservation of a
    relatively small number of generally dominant species is sufficient
    to maintain most processes

-   So there is a disconnect between those species of the highest
    conservation concern and those which appear ot provide the most
    function

-   Here the authors find that:

    -   Less common species can make significant ecosystem contributions

    -   Further investigation into the effects of rare and less common
        species on ecosystem maintenance is needed

    -   Further investigation should use a variety of approaches (*what
        does this mean*?)

    -   Until this research has been done we should employ a
        precautionary approach to the conservation of rare species

-   In the majority of ecological communities, most species exist in
    relatively low abundance (Howe 1999)

-   Currently however, most investigations of BD-EF focus on common
    species

-   Ecosystem processes are often linked to ecosystem health (Schaeffer
    et al. 1998, in Environmental Management 12(4) 445-455)

-   Why might less common species contribute?:

    -   Keystone species

        -   The loss of top predators can degrade ecosystems â€“ explosion
            of herbivory and habitat degradation

        -   Although rare species may nto be particularly productive,
            they do perform ecosystem processes (Marsh et al.
            2000), e.g. Equisetum species contribute lots of P,K to
            litter layers and soil nutrient pools, move limiting
            resouces from lower soil horizons to where other plants can
            get at them

    -   Aggregating the effects of diversity

        -   Ecologists have documented the role of diversity in EF by
            aggregating the effects of less common species

        -   E.g. invasion resistance (Lyons and Schwartz 2001)

    -   Temporal effectsloreau

        -   Rare species may become common rapidly following disturbance

        -   Ensures ecosystem functioning over time

**Rare species support vulnerable functions in High-Diversity
Ecosystems**

**Mouillot et al. 2013**

-   Do common species insure against the loss of fucnctions supported by
    rare species.

-   This issue is more critical in species-rich ecosystems where high
    functional redundancy among species is likely and where it is thus
    often assumed that ecosystem functioning is buffered against
    species loss.

-   Here, the authors show that the most distinct combinations of traits
    are often held by the rarest species.

-   Species with low functional redundancy and which support the most
    vulnerable functions are rarer than expected by chance in all three
    ecosystems

-   Most key ecosystem processes such as organic matter degradation,
    bioturbation, bioerosion and productivity are threatened by the loss
    of functions performed by particular species, some of which may
    be rare.

-   The authors call for new approaches that will specifically address
    the role of rarity and functional vulnerability in ecosystem
    functioning with, for example, experiments using species with known
    abundance and traits in controlled designs where species richness
    and relative abundances would be kept constant.

-   We should aim to disentangle the raltive contribution of rare and
    common species traits to complex ecosystem properties.
