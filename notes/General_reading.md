**Upslope migration of Andean Trees**

**Feeley *et al.*, 2011**

-   38 Andean Tree genera along the Kosnipata Valley

-   Measured changes within species and also the changes in genus level
    composition through time

-   Most shifted their mean distribution upslope (\~2.5-3.5 vertical
    metres per year)

-   Change is less than predicted (5.5-7.5m/yr) from the temperature
    increase due to the influence of non-climatic factors like
    substrate, species interactions, lags in response,
    dispersal limitation. May lead to range bottom coming up due to
    mortality but range top not increasing. (Chen, 2009; Lenoir, 2008)

    -   Indicates a limited ability to response to increased
        temperatures

    -   May increase extinction risk

        -   Due to reduction in habitat area, **biotic attrition**

-   Tropical species are hypothesised to be especially sensitive to
    changes in climate due to the low intrinsic variability of the
    tropics and highly specialised species (Deutsch, 2008; McCain, 2009)

-   Calculated DBH, recensused after 4 years to give info on mortality,
    recruitment, basal area growth.

-   Due to most species only occurring in one plot the analysis was done
    at the genus level

-   Centre of gravity measured as the mean elevation weighted by
    relative basal area per elevation

-   Measured a community elevation score, lower = an increase in
    relative abundance of tree genera from lower elevations.

-   More migrated upslope than downslope

**Spatial Patterns and recent trends in the climate of tropical
rainforest regions**

**Malhi & Wright, 2004**

-   Precipitation has declined at a rate of 1+-0.8%/10yrs, but no trend
    in Amazonia!

-   0.26C +/- 0.05C per decade, in synchrony with global rise attributed
    to anthropogenic greenhouse emissions

-   

**An evaluation of noninvasive methods to estimate foliar chlorophyll
content**

**Richardson *et al.*, 2002**

-   Antenna pigments in the leaf chloroplasts absorb sunlight, transfer
    it to the reaction centre pigments by resonance transfer, they
    release electrons and stimulate the photochemical process.

    -   Of the pigments, chlorophyll a and b are the most important

-   Why measure chlorophyll?

    -   The amount of solar radiation absorbed is largely a function of
        the concentration of pigments

    -   Leaf nitrogen is mostly in Chl, so can act as a proxy

    -   Stress causes chl to decrease and carotenoids to increase.

    -   The relative concentrations may change with factors like light,

-   Can be expressed as a concentration (/g) or as content (/cm^2^)

-   The non-destructive methods measure relative but not absolute
    concentration

-   machines measure absorbance of 2 WL of light, red (660nm) and
    near-infrared (940nm). Red is strongly absorbed and near infrared is
    a reference to adjust for differences in leaf structure

-   We would measure using the SPAD

**Altitudinal Change in the Photosynthetic Capacity of Tropical Trees: A
Case Study from Ecuador and a Pantropical Literature Analysis**

**Wittich *et al,* 2012**

-   Trees are the dominant life form in the tropical mountains from sea
    level to above 4000masl

-   Highly variable thermal conditions along this gradient

-   They used gas exchange measurement in mature trees to determine
    photosynthesis ni 40 tree species at 1000, 2000, 3000 masl

-   In Souther ECUADOR

-   No significant altitudinal trend

-   Area-based A~sat~ decreases in tropical mountains by
    \~1.3umolCO~2~/m^2^/s/km altitude, 0.2umolCO~2~/m^2^/s/K temperature
    decrease

-   Increase in leaf mass per area with altitude

-   Local geological nad soil fertility conditions and related foliar N
    & P concentrations considerably influenced altitudinal A~sat~
    patterns

-   ELEVATION IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR INFLUENCING THE P~s~ OF TROPICAL
    TREES

**Light-Dependent Leaf Trait Variation in 43 Tropical Dry Forest Tree
Species**

-   Measured sun and shade leaves of each species

-   Crown openness was measured using a LiCor hemispherical camera

-   4 leaves from each tree

    -   Width, length of leaf blade

    -   Folioles were considered the functional equivalent of leaves

    -   Length of the petiole and length and diameter of internode

    -   Leaf thickness

    -   Leaf wet mass

    -   Leaf area

    -   Leaf toughness

    -   Leaf dry mass

-   Converted to:

    -   Leaf density

    -   Leaf slenderness

    -   LMA

    -   Leaf Dry matter content

    -   Specific petiole length

    -   internode to leaf area ratio

**Acclimation of photosynthesis and respiration in asynchronous in
response to changes in temperature regardless of plant functional
group**

**Campbell *et al.*, 2007**

-   3 functional groups:

    -   Forbs

    -   Grasses

    -   Evergreen tree

-   Acclimation was greater for respiration than photosynthesis and
    differed between leaves experiencing a 10-d change in temp., and
    leaves newly developed at that temp.

-   Cold acclimation was associated with an increase in cytochrome
    oxidases non-structural CHO and N. Increased cytochrome oxidases
    in respiration. Initial decrease then recovery of thylakoid membrane
    proteins, increased proteins from the calvin cycle.

-   Anything from 30-80% of photosynthetically fixed carbon can later be
    released by respiration (Loveys *et al.*, 2002)

-   Increases in temperature normally result in an increase in the R:Ps
    because while respiration responds exponentially, Ps has a broad
    temperature optimum![](media/image1.png){width="3.75in"
    height="2.920543525809274in"}

-   Can divide acclimation into within existing tissue and within new
    tissue

-   It is not known whether constant R:A ratios are exhibited by leaves
    acclimated to a wider range of temperatures

-   Tjoelker found that broad leaved tree species exhibited a lower
    degree of acclimation of leaf photosynthesis than conifers

-   Asat and Rd were measured using a Li-Cor 6400 IRGA @400ppmCO~2~ &
    1500umol/m^2^/s^1^Light level

-   Fresh mass and leaf area was recorded using a Li-Cor 3100

-   Chlorophyll fluorescence was measured using a Mini-PAM

    -   Dark adapted Fv/Fm

**Growth response and acclimation of CO~2~ exchange characteristics to
elevated temperatures in tropical tree seedlings**

**Cheesman & Winter, 2013**

-   Under well-watered conditions all 10 neotropical tree seedlings
    showed optimum growth at temperatures above those found in their
    native ranges.

-   Tropical trees have adapted to live in a narrow range of
    temperatures and thus may be more sensitive to climate change
    (Ghalambor et al., 2006)

-   Gives evidence to suggest that some tropical tree seedlings have the
    capacity to maintain growth at temperatures above that of their
    current range

**Climate isn’t everything: Competitive Interactions and variation by
life stage will also affect range shifts in a warming world**

**Ettinger & HilleRisLambers, 2013**

-   Conifer study

-   Found that relationships between growth and competition differed by
    life stage and location.

-   Life history stages are influenced differently by changing climate.

-   In the upper limits of their ranges, climate had a great effect
    while at low elevations climate had low influence

-   Conversely, competitive effects were more important for saplings
    than adults but didn’t become more important at
    different elevations.

-   Climate only affects range limits at the treeline

-   Possible climatic tipping points followed by rapid range shift (Doak
    & Morris, 2010)

    -   Short term observations may not represent the long-term trend

-   ![](media/image2.png){width="5.0in" height="6.217617016622922in"}

-   Used annual growth measures of adult trees

-   Expected that climate constrains growth at upper limits, competitive
    interactions influence lower limit

-   Competition was quantified by canopy openness for saplings along
    with the distance to and DBH of all trees greater than 10cm DBH
    within a 10m radius and total basal area of neighbouring trees for
    the adult trees

Hypotheses:

1.  Climate determines range limits with adults and juveniles responding
    similarly

2.  Competition determines range limits with adults and juveniles
    responding similarly

3.  Climate determines upper and competition determines lower range
    limits, with juveniles more sensitive than adults

**Acclimation to humidity modifies the link between leaf size and the
density of veins and stomata**

**Murphy *et al.*, 2014**

-   High vapour pressure deficit (VPD) leaves were 1/3 the size of low
    VPD leaves with only marginally greater vein and stomatal density

-   Transpirational homeostasis was therefore maintained by reducing
    stomatal conductance

-   This was done by modifying the cell size (epidermal expansion)

-   The vein and stomatal density showed a small but coordinated
    response to growth under high and low VPD, contradicting the H1 that
    the balance between vein and stomatal density woukd be modified to
    uphold transpiration homeostasis

**Phenotypic Plasticity of Leaf Shape along a Temperature Gradient in
*Acer rubrum***

**Royer *et al.*, 2009**

-   Common garden experiments show that in most species, altitude
    affects Ps efficiency, leaf area, LMA

    -   Temp.

    -   Irradiance

    -   Water availability

    -   Disturbance

-   Leaves were dried, pressed and photographed against a black velvet
    background

-   Teeth area is measured by photoshopping out the teeth by cropping
    between the sinuses of the tooth

**Seifert *et al.*, 2014**

**  Competition indexes for trees**

-   Radius is defined as twice the mean of the distance between trees
    (SQRT(10,000)/number of trees per ha)

-   Basal area of larger trees

-   Basal area of all trees (Local Basal Area)

    -   Seifert, 2011 used this as a surrogate for below ground
        competition

-   Crowding index (Sum of DBH of all trees in area)

    -   Excludes the quadratic effect of larger trees as in local basal
        area

-   Iterative Hegyi (Sum of ((DBH competitor tree/DBH reference
    tree)\*(1/Distance between reference and competitor))\*Specific

**Landscape-scale changes in forest structure and functional traits
along an Andes-to-Amazon elevation gradient**

**Asner *et al.*, 2014**

          Airborne spectroscopy and LiDar to quantify changes in forest
structure and plant functional traits.

         Elevation positively correlated with canopy openness

         Elevation positively correlated with understorey ground cover

         Elevation negatively correlated with canopy height

         Elevation negatively correlated with the vertical partitioning
of vegetation in the canopy

         Soils in the lowland landscapes vary among three broad
classes:

> o   Ultisols – on *Terra firme* clay substrate
>
> o   Inceptisols – on inactive high-fertility floodplains of late
> Holocene age
>
> o   Entisols – white sand substrate, V. low nutrient availability

 

 

**Enemies maintain Hyperdiverse Tropical Forests**

**Terborgh, 2012**

         Diversity is upheld by:

> o   Intraspecific competition
>
> o   Interspecific competition
>
> o   Density responsive biotic agents
>
> o   Distance responsive biotic agents

         Evidence points towards host-generalist and host-restricted
biotic agents having the greatest effect on seed and seedling mortality

> o   Mostly this serves to even out distribution of surviving
> propagules
>
> o   Host-restricted agents are mostly micro-arthropods and funghi,
> which attack hosts in a distance dependent fashion

**Effects of soil chemistry on tropical forest biomass and productivity
at different elevations in the equatorial Andes**

**Unger *et al.*, 2012**

-   Of topsoil K, N mineralisation rate, soil pH, extractable Ca,
    extractable P:

    -   Only topsoil K covaried with Above ground biomass

-   Structural equation modelling (SEM – used to determine the best
    combination of independant variables to explain variation) revaled
    that nitrogen availability significantly influences productivity in
    these Andean forests, but both N and P affect the wood production
    indirectly through alterations of wood specific gravity

-   The growth promoting effect of N is larger than P.

-   soil cores were taken using a soil corer of 5cm diameter and 25cm
    length

    -   cores split into 2 sub samples, organic layer material and upper
        10cm of mineral layer

-   Measured the following parameters:

    -   Total carbon and nitrogen

    -   Resin-extractable phosphorous

    -   salt-exchangeable K, Mg, Ca, Al

    -   Soil pH

-   Would I need to do controls to see how the parameters acted with no
    plants????

-   Assumed a strong influence of the veg, on chemical compo, of the
    organic soil layers, all subsequent correlation and SEM analyses
    focussed on the mineral topsoil and its importance for veg.

-   used linear regressions to link elevation to soil parameters

-   To reduce the number of soil variables and to ensure the subsequent
    analyses were not affected by the problem of multi-colinearity, used
    a principal components analysis.

    -   summarised soil data in five independent axes

-   Used AMOS 5.0.1 software (Arbuckle, 2003) for SEM

    -   Started with a model that included all plausible paths between
        the soil chemical and the stand productivity variables

    -   Assessed goodness of fit using Chi^2^ value. Removed
        insignificant paths one after another to see if the Chi^2^ value
        dropped significantly

-   Total N, C:N, showed no clear elevational trend,

**A protocol for measurement and monitoring soil carbon stocks in
agricultural landscapes**

**2011 Betemariam et al.**

Sampling design

-   one option uses circular clusters one in each part of a grid drawn
    over the landscape, within this, sample points are randomly located
    with respect to the centre point

-   need to define the optimal allocation of sample points

-   for systematic samples, at angles from the seedling, but how far?

-   carbon samples taken from 0-20 and 20-50 cm depth increments

    -   these samples are pooled to make one representative sample from
        each plot

    -   done using an auger

    -   a 700g subsample is then collected for both the upper and lower
        pooled samples

-   Samples are processed

    -   air dried until constant mass

    -   Weigh

    -   2mm sieve roots, gravel,

    -   weigh coarse fragments

    -   should take a sub sample of about 350g of fine soil

    -   Cone and quarter until a 20g subsample for analysis is produced

    -   the rest should be retained

-   For NIR it is recommended to do a subsample that are tested with
    both NIR and conventional analysis to make sure it’s not way off..

-   MIR is better than NIR as it is up to 10% more precise but requires
    and extra grinding step. Can be used on small sample sizes

-   

**Carbon and nitrogen stocks in the soils of the amazon region**

**Batjes et al, 1999**

-   C density to 0.3m

-   N density to 1m

-   first did mean bulk density

**Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy for rapid soil analysis**

**Shepherd and walsh 2004**

**Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy – Principal components
regression analyses of soil properties**

-   did total C, total N, CEC to r^2^&gt;0.8

-   Various calibration methods have been used in the past to relate
    near-infrared spectra to the measured property

-   Morra et al 1991 concluded that NIRS could be used to measure soil N
    and C content

-   Used \~100g sample per measurement

-   spectral reflectance was averaged from 25 spectra, as the log of 1/
    reflectance at 2 nm intervals from 400-2498 nm

-   used a 8mm sieve

-   only spectra in the range of 1300-2500 nm were used to correlate
    with the soil properties

**Soil sampling for precision agrictulture,**

**Ferguson et al. 2009**

-   Recommend using an offset grid pattern

-   2-2.5 acres per sample, \~1-2/Ha

    -   We should probably do more as we want to differentiate between
        plants within a 1Ha spot

-   Each sample made up of 5 cores in a 10ft (3m) radius around the
    central point, taken at random intervals

-   But what depth???

My plan

-   samples around each seedling

-   Build a representative plot level sample

**Plant traits co-vary with altitude in grasslands and forests in the
European Alps**

**Pellissier *et al*. 2010**

-   Used the mean trait values per plot weighted by species cover in
    that plot, examined against the first axis of a PCA of local
    climatic conditions.

    -   Used a linear mixed model using lme4 to test this

        -   Habitat as expalanatory fixed factors

        -   Transect in which the plots belong as random factor

-   With increased altitude they observed:

    -   a decrease in anemophily and an increase in entomophily
        complemented by possible selfing

    -   Decrease in diaspores with appendages adapted to ectozoochory,
        linked to decrease in achenes and increase in capsules

**Competition between tree seedlings and herbaceous vegetation: support
for a theory of resource supply and demand**

**Davis *et al.* 1998**

-   Measured **competition intensity (CI)** along an experimental
    moisture-light gradient

-   Conclusion: Tree seedling success in savannas and grasslands may be
    strongly influenced by the intensity of competition from herbaceous
    vegetation

-   They propose that what matters to an individual plant is not so much
    a change in gross resource supply or change in abundance of
    competitor, but the extent to which resource availability is
    affected by changes in supply and demand

    -   Factors which reduce soil water content are likely to increase
        competition intensity (reduce seedling success)

-   Grime’s C-S-R model states that CI increases as disturbance and
    stress decline (1979,1985,1988)

    -   In my plot as altitude increases: abiotic stress increases,
        herbivory stress decreases

        -   Disturbance humped in the middle? (landslides)

    -   These theories are consistent with traditional r/K selection
        theory (MacArthur & Wilson 1967) – but this is a *zombie idea*
        (Dynamic ecology 2015)

-   **Methods**

    -   Bethel, Minnesota

    -   3x3x2 factorial field experiment

    -   Gathered morphological info on:

        -   the number of surviving seedlings of each species in each
            subplot

        -   Height

        -   Basal stem diameter

        -   Used height and diameter to determine woody shoot biomass
            using an allometric equation

    -   Gathered competition intensity data

        -   It has been found that for tree seedlings, growth and
            survival are not that closely linked (Walters and
            Reich, 1996)

> **The relative importance of deforestation, precipitation change, and
> temperature sensitivity in determining the future distributions and
> diversity of Amazonian plant species**
>
> **Feeley *et al.* 2012**

-   Used herbarium records to model the future distribution of ca. 3000
    amazonian plant species

-   Find that the future of amaxzonian diversity will be primarily
    dependent on species ability to tolerate or adapt to rising
    temperatures

-   The distributions of species are predicted to shift under climate
    change (Thuiller 2007, Walther et al. 2002)

-   In the tropics, higher climatic stability has resulted in higher
    niche specialisation and a reduced temperature tolerance range
    (climatic niches)

-   It is expected that lowland areas may experience higher rates of
    extinction due to the large distances between environmentally
    different habitats

-   They are likely to shift upslope rather than poleward

    -   This could reduce in a lower habitat space due to their being
        less space at altitude

-   There is a large paucity of data in tropical plants

    -   High number of species

    -   Low accessibility

**Malhi *et al.* 2010**

**Introduction: Elevation gradients in the tropics: laboratories for
ecosystem ecology and global change research**

-   Tropical forests have a major influence on patterns of biodiversity

-   Relatively understudied

-   It is not enough to simply compare tropical with non-tropical
    ecosystems due to the vast distances between them and the resulting
    differences in biogeographical effects

    -   We must compare among tropical biomes

-   We can increase our knowledge through studying environmental
    gradients within the tropics

-   Species distributions within the tropics have been recognised to be
    a function of:

    -   Climate

    -   Edaphic (soil) factors

-   It is likely that these environmental factors are likely to change
    at rates not seen before (Vuille et al. 2003, Bush et al. 2004,
    Urrutia & Vuille 2009)

-   5 major justifications for investing effort in studying these
    systems

    -   Elevational tropical ecosystems are evolutionarily and
        ecologically distinct from the lowland tropics, but not often
        written about

    -   Species turnover along elevational gradients accounts in large
        part for the high diversity in many of the earths biodiversity
        hotspots (myers et al. 2000)

    -   Tropical montane elevation transects are natural laboratories
        for understanding environmental controls on ecosystem function,
        especially temperature

        -   **In tropical regions, unlike temperate and polar
            elevational studies, the effects of season do not need to be
            unconfounded from those of ambient environmental impacts**

        -   BUT it is important to acknowledge that many other
            environmental variables co-vary with elevation, O~2~ or
            CO~2~ concentrations, UV radiation (Korner 2007)

    -   Tropical elevations are good sites for understanding past
        climate change in the tropics, palaeo-records are highly
        sensitive in these areas

    -   **Good for monitoring ongoing future impacts of atmospheric
        change in the tropics**

        -   Sensitive flora, they don’t have to be able to acclimate to
            changing temperature as much (NARROW THERMAL NICHES)

    -   ALSO – Tropical mountains are potential arks for biodiversity in
        a century of rapid warming

        -   Many species now considered montane were widespread in the
            lowaland amazon during much of the Pleistocene (Liu &
            Colinvaux, 1985, Bush et al. 1990)

**Pearson & Dawson 2003**

**Predicting the impacts of climate change on the distribution of
species: are bioclimate envelope models useful?**

-   Reviews and evaluates criticisms of bioclimatic envelope models

-   Although the complexity of the natural system presents fundamental
    limits to predictive modelling, the models can provide a useful
    first approximation as to the potentially dramatic impact of climate
    change on biodiversity

-   IT IS IMPORTANT OT CONSIDER THE SPATIAL SCALE AT WHICH THESE MODELS
    ARE BEING APPLIED

**The Use of ‘altitude’ in ecological research**

**Korner 2007**

Two categories of environmenta changes with altitude

-   Those physically tied to metres above sea level

    -   Atmospheric pressure,

        -   11%/km

        -   Affects gas exchange in plants

            -   Enhances the rate of CO~2~ uptake – but important
                interactions

        -   It is suggested that rather than a lack of CO~2~ causing an
            increase in stomata at altitude, it is the increase in solar
            radiation

    -   temperature,

        -   5.5K / km

        -   Low-stature vegetation can effectively de-coupl from free
            convection, increasing warming under solar radiation
            (increased temperature stress in seedlings?)

    -   clear-sky turbditiy

    -   Incoming solar radiation

    -   Increasing fraction of UV-B

-   Those that are not altitude specific

    -   Moisture

        -   Precipitation

    -   Hours of sunshine

    -   Wind,

        -   Contrary to popular belief, mountain ranges are among the
            less windy places on Earth owing to shelter

    -   Season length

    -   Geology

    -   Human land use

-   Comparisons become difficult because altitude effects on temperature
    interact with the architecture of plants, land surface
    characteristics, and solar radiation,

    -   Means it is difficult to make a global altitude-related theory
        of biological phenomena

-   Global geophysical changes with altitude

    -   Land area decreases with altitude

        -   Reduced niche diversity and breadth

    -   Increased spatial isolation with altitude

**On the use of elevation, altitude, and height in the ecological and
climatological literature **

**McVicar & Korner 2013**

-   The three words can be used interchangeably in everyday language
    but:

-   Elevation: the vertical distance between a point on the land surface
    and a reference point, usually M.A.S.L

-   Altitude: the vertical distance between any object and a reference
    point, usually m.a.s.l or m.a.land surface

-   Height: vertical distance between top of object and land surface,
    only where the object is in direct contact with the ground

    -   For packages, in R: citation(“package”)

-   Fitzmaurice et al. 2004 – normality isn’t needed provided the sample
    size is large enough

Violating the Assumptions: Exception or Rule?

-   Heterogeneity (heteroscedasticity)

Additive Modelling

-   Additive models are non-parametric regression methods

<!-- -->

-   Good to use when the data can’t be transformed to a normal
    distribution in a linear regression

-   Fits a smoothing curve through the data

-   install.packages(“gam”)

-   install.packages(“mgcv”)

-   Both these packages can do it, but each has it’s own quirks

-   “gam” is the classic one, it uses bak-fitting algorithm techniques

    &gt;library(gam)

    &gt;M1 &lt;- gam(y \~ lo(x, span = 0.5))

    &gt;plot(M1, se=TRUE)

    returns error message:

-   Error in array(x, c(length(x), 1L), if (!is.null(names(x)))
    list(names(x), :

    'data' must be of a vector type, was 'NULL'

**Pippa’s Full Project Proposal**

**Pippa Stone 2014**

-   Understnading plant distributions is an age old question (Cowles
    1899, Clements 1916, Gleason 1926)

-   It is well known that range limits, occupancy, and population
    density can all be greatly influenced by factors other than climate,
    such as biotic interactions (Davis et al. 1998, McCarthy-Neumann and
    Kobe 2008, Van der Putten et al. 2010, Ettinger et al. 2011)

    -   Fine et al. 2004, Wyatt and Silman 2004, Hillyer and Silman
        2010, Terborgh 2012 say how biotic interactions are likely to
        have an important effect on species distribs in tropical areas

-   There is also substantial heterogeneity between species in their
    responses to climate change, even within the same community
    (Parmesan et al. 1999, Moritz et al. 2008, Doak and Morris 2010,
    Feeley et al. 2011

-   Our inability to separate fundamental from realized niches in models
    affects our ability to predict species responses to climate change
    (Jackson and Sax 2010, Dawson et al. 2011)

-   There is decent evidence that species are migrating in our transect
    (Parmesan 2006, Beckage etal. 2008, Kelly and Goulden 2008, Chen
    et al. 2011, Feeley et al. 2011, Feeley 2012)

-   Species migrations under climate change will determine future
    biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services
    (Malcolm et al. 2002, Colwell et al. 2008, Feeley and Silman 2010b,
    a, Isbell et al. 2011)

-   Whether observed niches are fundamental or absolute niches leads to
    predicted rates of diversity decline from 100% to 8% (Feeley and
    Silman 2010a)

    -   If species are able to migrate to remain in equilibrium with
        climate then exitinctions may be few (Feeley and Silman 2010b,
        Parmesan 2006)

    -   But if species cannot keep up with warming, as is expected
        (Neilson et al. 2005, Parmesan 2006) then extinction rates will
        increase

    -   Secondary extinctions could also be expected due to novel biotic
        interactions (Jackson and Sax, Sheldon et al. 2011)

-   The Eastern Andes and the adjacent lowlands (Where we worked) are
    the Earth’s highest biodiversity area (Myers et al. 2000b

    -   Warming of a minimum of 4C is expected over the next century
        (Cramer et al. 2004, Urrutia and Vuille 2009)

        -   This means that Amazonian/Andean plant species will need to
            shift their distribution upwards by \~750m to remain in
            equilibrium with temperature. THAT IS… IF THEY CANNOT ADAPT.

        -   As a result, montane forests are being focussed on in
            conservation strategies, to help preserve them as arks.
            (Killeen and Solorzano 2008, Wright et al. 2009)

-   Most predictions of species migrations and extinctions have come
    from models with simplistic assumtptions such as:

    -   Species respond to the abiotic environment entirely due to
        bioclimatic envelopes,

    -   Migration is either in perfect equil or perfect disequil with
        climate

    -   All species respond the same way

-   While these models are useful for extreme scenarios within which to
    make policy decisions, which require fast actions (Feeley and Silman
    2010a, Feeley et al. 2012a)

-   The tropical Andes represents and ideal model system for
    investigating the factors which limit species distributions, and the
    distributional reponses of species to contemporary and future
    climate change (Mahli et al. 2010)

    -   A strong elevational:temperature gradient

    -   Little change in temp with latitude, so upward migration
        more probable. (Colwell et al. 2008, Loarie et al. 2009, Wright
        et al. 2009)

    -   Tropical species are highly specialised to their climate due to
        a lack of seasonal variation in climate (Janzen 1967, Ghalambor
        et al. 2006, Deutsch et al. 2008, McCain 2009)

    -   There is a background of past forest compositional changes
        consistent with climate-driven distributional shifts (Bush
        et al. 2004, Bush et al. 2005, Urrego et al. 2010)

    -   Regional temperatures in the Andes have exceeded the global
        average (Vuille and Bradley 2000)

    -   The temperature is likely to increase at a rate consistent with
        current change (Urrutia and vuille 2008)

-   Why seedlings?

    -   Accessibility

    -   Early life history stages are critically important in
        structuring lowland forest communities through differential
        reponses to both abiotic and biotic gradients within forest
        stands, and in reponse to rainfall (Engelbrecht et al. 2007,
        Comita and Engelbrecht 2009, Metz 2012)

    -   Ettinger and HilleRis Lambers 2013

-   Why permanent plots?

    -   Our permanent plots were established between 2003 and 2005, and
        recensused in 2007, 2010, and 2011,

**Pippa Project Overview**

**Pippa Stone 2015**

-   Only including stuff not included in the full proposal

-   Cheesman and winter 2013, There is a lack of mechanistic data on
    tropical species’ reponses to warming

-   Leaf photosynthesis and respiration changes with elevation (Wittich
    et al. 2012) and growth temperature (Krause et al. 2010, Doughty
    2011, Cheesman and Winter 2013)

-   Light intensity affects seedling establishment and growth (Kobe
    1999, Turner 2001, Krause et al. 2012)

-   Photosynthesis has a greater sensitivity to high temperatures than
    respiration (Campbell et al. 2007)

-   **Pfundel 2007 shows a fluorescence trace **

**Survival, growth, and photosynthesis of tree seedlings competing with
herbaceous vegetation along a water-light-nitrogen gradient**

**Davis *et al.* 1999**

-   In herbaceous dominated patches and ecosystems, tree establishment
    is influenced partly by ability of seedlings to grow in direct
    competition with herbaceous vegetation

-   Studied the importance of season long wet and dry spells on the
    competitive interactions between herbaceous vegetation and OAK
    seedlings

    -   Along a light and nitrogen gradient

    -   in an infertile secondary successional grassland in N. Am.

    -   2 levels of light,

    -   Three levels of nitrogen input

    -   Three levels of water input

    -   With and without herbaceous vegetation

-   Seedling survival, growth, and rate of photosynthesis were
    significantly affected by competition with herbacoues vegetation,
    these effects varied along the multiple resource gradients.

-   Seedlings survival of both species of oak was significantly greater
    in

    -   wetter plot

    -   shaded plots,

    -   when surrounding vegetation was removed

    -   higher nitrogen plots

-   Seedling survival rate and photosynthesis rate was highly correlated
    with available soil water

-   Seedlings can be vulnerable to acute periods of stress

    -   Drought

    -   Frost

    -   Herbivory

-   Holmgren et al. 1997 proposed that shade from canopy trees may
    alternatively facilitate or inhibit success of woody seedlings
    depending on soil water conditions

    -   At dry sites, shade would increase success by reducing water
        stress

-   Soil water declines with increasing herbaceous biomass (Zutter
    et al. 1986)

-   Herbaceous biomass in found to increase with elevated soil nitrogen
    levels (Tilman 1988)

    -   The seedling reduction in survival as a result of drought might
        be offset in areas with higher nitrogen

**Beyond predictions: Biodiversity in a changing climate**

**Dawson *et al.* 2011**

-   Here, the authors review the insights that different approaches
    bring to the biodiversity consequences of climate change

-   Much of the information we have is at the species level but we could
    look at ecosystem level effects, habitats, community assemblages

-   Climate change could lead to

    -   Loss of biodiversity

    -   Termination of evolutionary potential

    -   disruption of ecological services

-   To date, assessments of climate change impacts of biodiversity have
    been largely based on climate envelope models (niche models), but
    these studies ignore many other facets of vulnerability of species:

    -   Exposure

    -   Sensitivity

    -   Adaptive capacity

-   Additional sources of info include:

    -   Observations of responses to climate change

    -   Experiments

    -   Mechanistic modelling based on ecophysiology and population
        biology

-   These studies show a range of acclamatory abilities among species,
    leafing to diverse consequences for biodiversity among groups.

-   **HOW RELIABLE IS THE CURRENT GENERATION OF PREDICTIONS?**

-   Climate change is projected to become equally or more important than
    land use change in the coming decades (Leadley et al. 2010)

-   Assessing the biodiversity consequences of climate change is
    complicated by:

    -   uncertaineies about the degree, rate, and nature of projected
        climate change,

    -   likelihood of novel and disappearing climates

    -   diversity of individual-species responses to a broad suite of
        interacting climate variables

    -   interactions of climate change with other biotic factors and
        stressors such as competition, trophic relationships, land use,
        invasive species, pathogens, pollutants

-   USE FIGURE 1 in introduction

    -   Direct observations are good at broad scales and can be used to
        assess all aspects of vulnerability

    -   Palaeological records extend the observational foundation to
        encompass a broader range of rates, magnitudes and kinds of
        climate change, good for theoretical understanding. Can reveal
        adaptive capacity and risks

    -   Climate envelopes are good for assessment of exposure

    -   Mechanistic models such as population models and
        ecophysiological models are diverse and taxon specific in
        their parameters. Particularly good at assessing sensitivity and
        adaptive capacity

    -   Experimental manipulations provide info provide info on
        sensitivity and adaptive capacity and are valuable in
        parametrising mechanistic models

-   The focus of management on such a singular scientific approach means
    that there is a risk of policy or management failures

-   The efficacy of climatic envelope models in assessing extinction
    rick and delineating suitable future habitats, and predicting
    ecological outcomes, IS UNPROVEN

    -   Critiques centre on:

    -   the correlative nature of the niche models,

    -   scale dependency,

    -   the difficulty of reliable extrapolation outside observed
        climate space,

    -   failure to represent key ecological and evolutionary processes

-   Climatic models are good at explaining current distributions but
    fail in prediucting future

-   There is more evidence for range expansion that for range
    contratction

-   While it may appear that many species are dealing with climate
    change according to bioclimatic envelope models, it may be that
    extinction lags are yet to act (28)

-   Loss of ecosystem functioning may involve threshold transitions

-   Recent case studies suggesr that climate variables and the way they
    interact with species life history can be complex and context
    specific

-   The use of observational evidence will need to be applied alongside
    knowledge of the biological differences among species

-   Many species populations have the ability to adjust to climate
    change in situ though phenotypic plasticity and micro-evolution

-   Many populations are able to disperse locally to suitable
    microhabitats

-   **OUTLOOK**

-   Many orthodox conservation practices like restoration and protection
    of habitats and the removal of anthropogenic pressures unrelated to
    climate, will continue to increase species and ecosystem adaptive
    capacity

**Impacts of Climate change on the future of biodiversity**

**Bellard et al. 2012**

-   Species can respond to climate change by shifting their climate nich
    along 3 axes:

    -   Time (phenology

    -   Space

    -   Self (Physiology)

-   Current estimate are very variable, depending on:

    -   Method

    -   Taxonomic group

    -   Biodiversity loss metric

    -   Spatial scales

    -   Time periods considered

-   Leadley et al. 2010 says that climate change could surpass habitat
    destruction in the coming decades in terms of threat to biodiversity

-   Climate change is expected to decrease genetic diversity of
    populations due to directional selection and rapid migration, which
    could in turn affect ecosystem functioning and resilience (Botkin
    et al. 2007, but see Meyers & Bull 2002)

-   Various effects on species populations are likely to modify the web
    of interactions at the community level (Gilman et al. 2010,
    Walther 2010)

-   A study of 9650 interspecific systems, including pollinators and
    parasitesm suggested that around 6300 species could disappear
    following the extinction of their associated species (Koh et al.
    2004).

-   **Possibly use figure 1 or adapted version – climate change
    effects + biodiversity component changes**

-   The millennium ecosystem assessment forecasts shifts of 5-20% of
    Earth’s terrestrial ecosystems (Sala et al. 2005)

-   Micro-evolution is the adaptation through new mutation, plasticity
    is the short term response.

-   Visser 2008, novel biotic interactions and other abiotic factors may
    influence survival in new ranges

-   Johansen and Jones 2011, some physiological changes in response to
    climate change have already been observed

-   Chevin et al. 2010, physiological changes may reach a staturation
    point beyond which they can’t change any more

-   Changes in ‘self’ have different ecosystem response results than for
    space and phenology adjustments, as they involve species staying in
    the same place

-   While relatively few species went extinct during quaternary climate
    change, the magnitude and rate of change at present will probably
    lead to greater losses

-   Current models mostly focus on changes in space rather than
    phenology or physiology

-   Thomas et al. 2004 give information on bioclimatic niche models

-   Soberon and Nakamura take issue with the methodology of bioclimatic
    envelope models

-   Sinclair et al. 2010 give information on the large proportion of
    species distribution models which are bioclimatic envelope models

-   Dynamic vegetation models predict the changes in habitat type at
    broader resolutions.

    -   They often classify species into plant functional types, but
        currently there are few of thse that a rigorously defined

    -   These models take into account lots of climatic factors such as
        temp, precip, humidity, sunshine days, topographical
        constraints,

    -   Van Vuuren et al. 2006

-   Bioclimatic models also have positive aspects:

    -   Can be applied across a large number of species in many
        taxonomic groups

    -   Implicitly capture many ecological processes in the
        relationshhip between occurrence data and spatial info

    -   Requires few data

-   Negative aspects of BEMs

    -   Don’t explicitly account for mechanisms that mediate species
        ranges

    -   May handle novel climates poorly due to lack of data

    -   Lack temporal dynamics

    -   Assume the current distribution of a species is a good indicator
        of suitable climate

        -   Lots of species are not as climate specific as these models
            would make out

-   Local scale losses could be anything from 0 – 100 % for plant
    species worldwide up until 2100

-   Lavergne et al. 2010, numerous studies have shown that species are
    capable of phenotypic plasticity and microevolution

-   Populations can be locally adapted to a specific cliomatic condition
    and therefore treating species as a single homogenous unit is dumb

-   Currently the probability of extinction is based on a projection of
    suitable habitats entirely lost, But it is possible that species
    will compensate for this habitat reduction with changes in
    demographic rates (reproduction rates?) (doak and morris 2010).

    -   Population viability analysis could help in this case

    -   But it requires data often not there

-   Co-extinctions will probably occur if certain species go extinct.
    Not often considered

-   Political protection should be prioritised for places that minimise
    the effects of climate change like forests, which contribute
    strongly to local climate conditions, they are also climate arks for
    refugees (Carnaval et al. 2009)

**Keeping up with a warming world: assessing the rate of adaptation to
climate change**

**Visser 2008**

-   If we set a maximal rate of adaption then we can set an upper limit
    for temperature change rate without significant biodiversity loss

-   Primarily set by microevolution rate

    -   Phenotypic plasticity will not act properly because reaction
        norms will no longer be adaptive

    -   While learning will be favourable to individuals it will not be
        passed down

    -   Maternal effects, because they are a form of phenotypic
        plasticity, will not be adaptive any more

    -   Adaptation via immigration of individuals with novel genotypies
        will also involve microevolution as temperature differences are
        not the only thing that will change in new areas, e.g.
        photoperiod

-   FINISH

**Forecasting the effects of global warming on biodiversity**

**Botkin et al. 2007**

-   In this article they compare and discuss differen uses of 4
    forecasting models:

    -   Models which consider species individually

    -   Models which follow niche theory, grouping species into habitat
        groups

    -   General circulation models , coupled ocean-atmosphere-biosphere
        models

    -   Species-area curve models which condier all species implicityly

-   We should make better use of palaeological records and modern
    genetic studies

-   To improve forecasts of biodiversity we should:

    -   Select a specific definition of biodiversity – use value,
        intrinsic value, abundance, evenness, scales

    -   Evaluate models prior to using them – many models forecast into
        the future without validating first using independent data.

    -   Account for multiple causes of change in biodiversity – we must
        also include factors like habitat fragmentation, pollution,
        over-abstraction, selective logging

    -   Obtain robust empirical data and implement it in the models –

    -   Use fossil records to understand the mechanisms which preserve
        biodiversity under changing climate and implement this
        understanding in models

    -   Improve widely used modelling methods – it is thought that
        models which require species specific information are not
        practicable at the global scale

    -   Model individuals

-   BASICALLY – We need to make models for total biodiversity, while
    preserving variation between species and within populations

**Interspecific and intraspecific variation in tree seedling survival:
effects of allocation to roots versus carbohydradfggfhjhgfhhyhte
reserves**

**Canham et al. 1999 **

-   Predicted that allocation to carbohydrate reserves would vary as a
    function of the phenology of shoot growth

    -   Hypothesised a tradeoff between aboveground growth and
        carbohydrate storage

-   Allocation to root structural biomass varied among species and as a
    function of light but did not respond to the defoliation treatments

-   Allocation to carb reserves varied among species and the two species
    with the most determinate shoot growth patterns had the highest
    total carb mass reserves but not the highest concentrations

-   Total mass and concentration were both significantly reduced by
    defoliation

-   Approximately linear relationship between carb reserves and survival
    in the following year

-   If they had not distinguished between reserves and structural
    biomass, they would have erroenousl concluded that allocation to
    roots was significantly positively related to survival.

    -   Instead it was allocation to carb reserves

**Rapid range shifts of species associated with high levels of climate
warming**

**Chen et al. 2011**

-   Meta-analysis – distributions have recently shifted to higher
    elevations at a median rate of 11.0 meters per decade (mean -= 12.2
    m decade^-1^ SE = 1.8, to higher latitudes at 16.9 km per decade

-   Approximately 2 and 3x faster than previously reported

-   Individual species vary massively in their rates of change

-   Suggests that species depends on multiple internal species traits
    and external drivers of change

-   Previous evidence has fallen just short of demonstrating a direct
    link between temperature change and range shifts

-   Compared to (14), these rates are 2-3x higher

-   Mean latitudinal shifts are not consistently lagging behind climate
    change

-   There is more lag in elevational migration than latitudinal

    -   Maybe this is because, as the tops of mountains are reached,
        there is more non-temperature related change and there is
        less space. Maybe at the tops of mountains there is more
        distance between suitable habitats (i.e. on a
        different mountain)

-   25% of species shifted downhill rather than uphill, as is expected

-   Reasons for heterospecific response to warming:

    -   Time delays in species responses

    -   Individualistic physiological constraints

    -   Interactions between drivers of change

    -   E.g. habitat specialists or immobile specis (17, 21-23). Species
        that have traits associated with low extinction or colonisation
        rates

    -   Sensitivty to climate change may vary across the life cycle, or
        across the seasons

    -   21,28 species may be influenced by multispecies interactions
        which themselves may depend on lots of drivers

        -   E.G. A species may retreat southwards if its range contracts
            with habitat loss faster than it expands through climate
            warming, whereas a species which thrives in novel
            agricultural landscapes may move northward faster
            than expected. (THINK OF AN EXAMPLE FOR ELEVATION).

-   More specific physiological, ecological and environmental data are
    required to provide specific prognoses for individual species.

**Climate change projections for the tropical Andes using a regional
climate mode: Tmeperature and precipitation simulations for the end of
the 21^st^ century**

**Urrutia & Vuille 2009**

-   High elevation tropical mountain regions may be more strongly
    affected by future climate change than surrounding lowlands

-   Presentation of first results for the end of the 21^st^ century
    using a regional climate model (RCM) based on 2 emission scenarios

-   The model simulates spatial and temporal variability of precip and
    temp but displays a cool and wet bias, particularly along the
    eastern andes during the wet season (December – February)

-   Changes in precipitation are spatialluy much less coherent, both
    regions of increased and decreased precip across the andes

    -   But there is a general trend of decreased precipitation

-   This mountain region presemts a particular challenge for climate
    modelling

    -   Complex topography

    -   Steep climatic gradients

-   Climate in tropical south America at the end of the 21^st^ century
    is dominated by a significant warming over the entire model domain,

    -   2-7C increase, depending on locqation and scenario considered.

**Leaf traits and foliar CO2 exchange in a Peruvian tropical montane
cloud forest**

**van de Weg 2011 (Thesis)**

-   Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF)

    -   Regular presence of clouds and mist associated with mountainous
        orography (Hamilton 1995a)

    -   Stunted tree growth

    -   Sclerophyllous leaves

    -   High abundance of vascular and non-vascular epiphytes

    -   Lower above-ground productivity

    -   Lower LAI

    -   Lower litterfall

    -   High rates of endemism (Hamilton 1995b, Foster 2001)

-   While TMCFs cover only 2.5% of the earth, they attract lots of
    conservation attention:

    -   Important hydrological role through capture of fog, and high
        rainfall

    -   Species rich

    -   High endemism

-   At lower altitudes, TMCFs are at risk of fragmentation and removal
    of habitat thrugh logging and clearance for grazing, coffe, and
    sugar cane

-   At higher latitudes TMCFs are often subject to high rates of burning
    for pastoral land (Sarmiento and Frolich 2002l, Martinez 2009)

-   Still et al. 1999, it is expected that TMCFs optimum climatic
    ocnditions will increase in altitude by several hundred meters ofver
    the next century

    -   Or they might disappear entirely (Williams et al. 2007)

-   The migration rate of trees in TMCFs has been less rapid than up
    slope trend in climate in Peruvian andes Feeley & Silman.

-   TMCFs have lower productivity thant their lowland counterparts, also
    lower standing biomass and stunted tree growth form, Why?: (Moser
    et al. 2007, Kitayama and Aiba 2002)

    -   Lower temperatures (Caldwell et al. 1980, Barry 1981)

    -   Frequent cloud immersion – lower directPAR, higher diffuePAR
        (Moser et al. 2007)

    -   Increase in relative humidity (Grubb and Whitmore 1966,
        Bruijnzeel and Procter 1995)

    -   Lower nutrient availability with altitude, because of lower
        mineralisation rates due to lower temperatures and lower
        densities of invertebrates(Illig et al. 2008, Richardson et al.
        2005)

        -   Nitrogen is especially less available to TMCF plants
            compared with phosphorous because microbial N-fixation is
            inhibited, while P is less affected because tropical soils
            of intermediate ages are known to have higher P availibilty
            than old undisturbed tropical soils (Pearson and Vitousek
            2002, Porder et al. 2007)

-   LAI shows lower AGB at higher altitudes

-   In TMCFs is it most likely that temperature and light availability
    play the largest role in photosynthesis capacity, rather than
    hydraulic constraints

-   Limited studies on sap flow and transpiration show no evidence of
    midday depression (the closing of stomata, often soon after midday,
    when Vapor pressure deficits are experienced)

**Biodiversity, climate change, and ecosystem services**

**Mooney *et al.* 2009**

-   Ecosystems are already under stress, meaning ecosystem services are
    also stressed

-   Climate change presents another stress on ecosystem services

-   60% of ecosystem services have been diminished by human activities,
    the rate of loss peaking in the last 50 years \[1\]

-   Not all species are equal in terms of how ecosystem mfunction

    -   Mostly the dominant and abundant species have a larger impact on
        functioning

    -   But rarer keystone species may also have aprofound impact

    -   \[3\]

-   Climate change will differentially affect interacting species

    -   Pollinator/plant

    -   Plant/herbivore \[33\] \[34\]

-   \[35\] climate change may outstrip the potential for many species to
    to adapt and evolve to climate change

-   \[36\] there will be novel climate combinations never experienced by
    any of the ecxtant biota in the future

-   There has been a significant upward shift in the elevational ranges
    of 171 forest plant species growing from sea level to 2600 m in
    Europe, 29m / decade \[38\]

    -   Species at higher elevations were more sensitive to changes in
        temperature

-   In Yosemite, over 50 years, 500 m upward shift in distributional
    limits for half of 28 species studied \[39\]

    -   Lowland species increased their elevational distribution, while
        upland species had their overall range contracted, indicating a
        restructuring of community relationships

-   There is a growing mismatch between species in trophic chains

-   Thomas et al. \[61\] used a climate envelope model to predict
    species loss, 15-37% by 2050, species committed to extinction

-   \[64\] bioclimate models make important solutions that aren’t always
    judtifies

-   \[65\] substantial differences between models need to be taken into
    account

**Rapid responses of British butterflies to opposing forces of climate
and habitat change**

**Warren *et al.* 2001**

-   This is the first study to combine the impacts of climate and
    habitat change

-   All 46 species of butterfly which hhave their northerly range limits
    in the North of Britain

-   Negative responses to habitat loss have outweighed the positive
    responses to climate change

-   Generalists expanded while specialists declined,
    generalist/specialist == mobile/sedentary

    -   If sedentary species continue to decline as a result of isolated
        habitats, then landscapes will become increasingly dominated by
        mobile generalists, homogenising biodiversity over space

**The Future of Tropical Species on a Warmer Planet**

**Wright *et al.* 2009**

-   Tropical forest species will be particularly sensitive to global
    warming

-   Given a moderate emissions scenario, 75% of species will experience
    mean annual temperatures in 2100 that are greater than the highest
    mean annual temperature that supports closed canopy forest today

-   Species will respond to global earming through acclimation,
    evolutionary adaptation, and range shifts

-   Most of the time, the tropics experience a lower temperature
    increase than northern latitudes

-   Lowland tropical species are expected to be more sensitive to
    temperature changes than either upland or more northerly species

-   Ghalambor et al. 2006, many species have adapted to function within
    narrow temperature limits in the tropics

    -   Deutsch et al. 2008, Tewksbury et al. 2008

-   Any contractions in the area of species in the tropics would have
    great consequences for global biodiversity, as the tropics hold the
    majority of terrestrial species

-   Terborgh 1973 – the rate of temperature change with latitude
    approaches 0 near the tropics

-   As global temperatures increase, refugees from warmer areas are
    likely to be adapted to the new warmer climate than those originally
    from the cooler area (Bush 2002) – in the tropics this is likely to
    be seen in montane environmenta but not with latitude

-   Raupach et al. 2007, global climate is changing rapidly as emission
    rates of anthropogenic greenhouse gases accelerate (Raupach
    *et al.* 2007)

-   In the tropics, temperature increases have averaged 0.26C per decade
    since the 1970s (Malhi and Wright 2004)

-   The future climates of areas supporting tropical species will be
    wetter than modern tropical grasslands and deserts and warmer than
    modern tropical forests. Williams et al. 2007

-   Individual tropical trees have long generation times, this poses a
    problem when considering the rapid changes in temperature which are
    likely to occur (Chambers et al. 1998)

    -   Therefore the acclamatory potential of tree species is important

-   Two sorts of novel biotic interactions in a warming climate:

    -   Climate dependent performance will alter interactions among
        longterm sympatric species (Tylianakis et al. 2008

    -   Range extensions and contractions will vary from species to
        species, and species will mix in novel combinations (Bush et al.
        2008

    -   Species will differ in their reaction to these interactions

-   The absence of long term ecological studies in the tropics hinders
    the predictions of biological response to climate change
    (Clark 2007)

-   The most straightforward way to mitigate the effects of climate
    change on tropical diversity is to reduce the magnitude of change,
    by controlling GHG emissions

**Projected distributions of novel and disappearing climate by 2100AD**

**Williams *et al.* 2007**

-   Novel 21^st^ century climate may promote novel species associations

-   The disappearance of some climates increases the risk of extinction
    for some species with narrow climatic niches

-   Novel climates are projected to develop in tropical and subtropical
    regions

-   Disappearing climates are expected to be concentrated in tropical
    montane regions (and the poleward portions of continents)

-   12-39% and 10-48% of the earths terrestrial surface will feature
    novel and disappearing climates respectively by 2100AD based on the
    A2 scenario from the IPCC

-   4-20% and 4-20% for the B1 scenario

-   There is a close relationship between the regions with disappearing
    climates and those previously identified as biodiversity hotspots,

    -   In these regions, standard conservation solutions may be
        insufficient to preserve BD

        -   E.g. assisted migration through reserves and corridors

        -   Because the climates to which they are best suited are
            insufficient

-   Future climate changes may cause a range of ecological responses
    (Figure 1 – maybe include in introduction)

    -   **Shifts in species distributions**

    -   **Community disaggregation sp.1&3**

    -   **New community formation sp2&3**

    -   **Extinction sp4**

    -   This is bcked up by responses to the last deglaciation

-   **Dispersal limitations may cause species ranges to lag behind
    climate change, promoting the formation of disequilibrial
    relationships between species distributions and climate **

-   Rapid cliomate changes further enhance extinction risk as they may
    be faster than species’ ability to adjust by migration and
    colonisation

-   Local climate changes are largest in the tropical and subtropical
    region

> **Global change and species interactions n terrestrial ecosystems**
>
> **Tylianakis *et al.* 2008**

-   A meta-analysis shows that the main drivers of Global environmental
    shcnage often alter competitive interactions among plants and
    animals

    -   exert multitrophic effects on the decomposer food web,

    -   increase intensity of pathogen infection,

    -   weaken mutualisms involving plants,

    -   enhance herbivory

    -   Variable effects on predation

-   Many studies contradict each other as to the direction and magnitude
    of effects of any singular GEC driver and any biotic interactions

-   THE GREATEST SINGULAR CHALLENDE OF ALL:

    -   Will be to determine how biotic and abiotic context alters the
        direction and magnitude of GEC effects on biotic interactions

-   Complex networks of interactions do these things:

    -   Maintain biodiversity (Bascompte et al. 2006)

    -   Mediate ecosystem mresponses to GEC (Brooker 2006, Suttle
        *et al.* 2007)

    -   Stability of ecosystem services upon which human well-being is
        dependent (Ives and Carpenter 2007)

**Species richness changes lag behind climate change**

**Menendez **et al.** 2006**

-   Species energy theory predicts that climate warming should have
    driven increases in species richness in coll and species poor areas
    of the northern hemisphere

    -   This has happened but much more slowly than expected

-   The resultant species assemblages are increasingly dominated by
    generalist species, able to respond quickly

-   It is suggested that time lag is responsible, as it can be overcome
    by introducing species to areas beyond their ranges successfully

-   It may be that the lag period is centuries or decades

**Are mountain passes higher in the tropics? Janzen’s hypothesis
revisited**

**Ghalambor *et al.* 2006**

-   A response to Janzen 1967 (Why mountain passes are higher in
    the tropics)

    -   Predicted that tropical mountain passes would present a more
        effective barrier to organismal dispersal than would
        temperate-zone passes of equivalent altitude

    -   Because of the annual variation in ambient temperature in the
        tropics – low

        -   Reduced seasonal overlap in thermal regimes between low and
            high latitude sites

        -   Select for organisms with low temperature niches

    -   Predicts and increase in species turnover over elevation with
        decreasing latitude

-   Biologists have long appreciated that abiotic (temperature,
    insolation, humidity etc.) as well as biotic factors(competition
    predation parasitism), influence species ranges

-   Janzen’s hypothesis provided a novel perspective for the role
    abiotic effects and physiological tolerance could plat in
    understanding patterns observed in the tropics

-   Key assumptions of Janzens hypothesis

    -   The effectiveness of a topographic barrier depends on the
        magnitude of the temperature gradients across the barrier

    -   Latitude, seasonality, and altitude influence between-altitude
        climate overlap

    -   Tropical organisms have narrow ranges of thermal tolerance,
        independent of altitude

    -   Tropical organisms evolve limited acclimation responses

    -   MAIN: Tropical organisms have reduced dispersal across
        elevational gradients and have reduced between-altitude overlap
        of their distributions

**Measuring the importance of competition in plant communities**

**Freckleton *et al.* 2009**

-   Many make the distinction between competition intensity and
    competition importance

    -   Intensity = absolute proximate effects on individuals

    -   Importance = relative effects of competition on ecological or
        evolutionary processes

-   They argue that recent analyses have generated new problems because
    of a failure to measure the importance in terms of individual
    fitness or per capita rates of population change

-   It is not possible to directly measure importance from short-term
    experiments (i.e .one generation or less), data from artificial
    conditions

-   We must provide a definition of importance that can be cited, as too
    often researchers say it without being clear

-   $Intensity = \frac{size\ attained \times (Number\ of\ competitiors)}{\text{Max\ size\ possible\ in\ the\ absence\ of\ competion}}$

    -   E.g. can relate also to population growth rate, biomass, seed
        production, recruitment

    -   $\frac{N_{t + 1}}{N_{t}} = gSw(N_{t})$ where S is the production
        of seeds, g is the proportion of seeds which survive

**The role of biotic interactions in shaping distributions and realised
assemblages of species: implications for species distribution
modelling**

**Wisz *et al.* 2013**

-   To understand which species will coexist in the future and where, we
    must understand how biotic and abiotic environments interact with
    dispersal processes and history across scales.

-   Biotic interactions and their dynamics influence species
    relationship with climate

-   The roles of biotic interactions beyond local extents &gt;10km2 are
    usually dismissed as unimportant

-   A range of species distrubtuon modelling tools is available to
    quantify species environmental relatipnships and predict species
    occurrence

    -   Integrating pairwise dependencies

    -   Using integrative predictors

    -   Hybridising species distribution models (SDMs) with dynamic
        models

-   Previously we have needed a priori knowledge of which species
    interact and have assumed that interactions are constant in space
    and time

    -   We must collect more data which is spatially and temporally
        explicit

    -   (van Dam 2009)

-   Gilman et al. 2010 argued that interactions among species can
    strongly influence how climate change affect species at every scale,
    that failure to incorporate these interactions limits our ability to
    predict species responses to climate change

-   Biotic interactions can affect species response to abiotic
    environmental changes differently along environmental gradients, and
    that abiotic environmental changes can influence the nature of
    biotic interactions (Brooker 2006, Meier et al. 2010a)

-   Evidence of how biotic interactions have shaped species
    distributions at broad spatial extents has received little attention
    in the context of predicting future species assemblages

-   Wiens 2011 concluded that there is a paucity of good examples of
    large scale patterns created by biotic interactions

-   Bioclimatic envelope models (also called SDMs here) typically relate
    species distributions to spatially explicit abiotic
    constraints (e.g. Guisan & Zimmermann 2000, Guisan & Thuiller 2005)

    -   Recent advances such as dispersal (e.g. Engler & Guisan 2009)
        are now included in these models

    -   Biotic interactions (Pellissier et al. 2012, Meier et al. 2010b)

-   Evidence of how plant competition ad facilitation affect species’
    geographic ranges over broad geographic extents islimited, probably
    because competitive exclusion between pairs of plant species may be
    inefficient due to their sessile nature

-   Gotzenberger (2012) found no evidence that competition has shaped
    plant distributions at broad spatial extents – but also acknowledged
    a lack of data was part of this

-   The ability of some plants to grow and reproduce in botanical
    gardens under other climatic condisions has also been interpreted to
    suggest that biotic interactions restrict their natural distribs
    (Vestas 2002)

-   The interactions between plants and their soil biot can serve as an
    important determinant of plant range expansion under global change

-   There is evidence that those species which are shifting their ranges
    in response to climate change show different interactions with their
    below-ground and above ground antagonists than related species that
    are not shifting (Engelkes et al. 2008)

-   Plant species richness can also be greatly impaired if their
    mutualists are not present (Nunez, Horton & Simberloff 2009). The
    expansion of some tree species may have been limited by the
    comparably slow rate of migration of their mycorrhizal mutualists

-   Challenges in applying interaction data to SDMs

    -   Inferring causation from spatial data

        -   If the distribution of one species is shown to be highly
            dpenednent on another species, there is no way to tell if
            this is due to a ral interaction or is better explained by
            one or more overlooked environmental factors not accounted
            for in the model

    -   Species occur in complex networks

        -   Bacompte 2009, Higher-order interactions may lead to
            non-additive effects which cannot be represented by the
            pairwise approaches presented above

        information gained from fine grained experiments and
        observational studies across a broad range of scales

**Effects of root competition and openness on survival and growth of
tree seedlings in a tropical seasonal dry forest**

**Gerhardt 1996**

-   Costa Rica

-   An experiment using thinning (canopy cover) and trenching
    (root competition) treatments

-   Root trenching increased survival in the deciduous site but had less
    effect in the semi-evergreen site

-   Growth was positively affected by trenching at both the decid and
    evergreen site

-   High light levels improved growth in the we season but had a
    negative impact in the dry season causing exacerbated dessication

**Altidudinal variation in leaf mass per unit area, lead tissue density
and foliar nitrogen and phosphorus content along an Amazon-Andes
gradient in Peru**

**Van de Weg et al. 2009**

-   Leaf traits are important for determining the capacity for a plant
    to acquire carbon, but there isn’t much data on it in the Andean
    cloud forests

-   LMA increased with latitude (62.8 – 169.4 g m^-2^)

-   LMA was lower than in comparable tropical elevation gradients

-   Foliar nitrogen by mass decreased with elevation

-   N limitation was not present expect at above 3000m

-   Characteristics of tropical montane cloud forests

    -   Reduction in air temperature

    -   Reduction in atmospheric pressure

    -   Increases in clear sky solar radiation flu

    -   Higher UV as a result of decreased atmospheric turbidity
        (Barry 1981)

    -   High diurnal variation in temperature, little seasonal variation
        (Rundel 1994)

-   Montane cloud forests have a lot of cloud! (Stadtmuller 1987)

-   When cloud forests are immersed in cloud they experience:

    -   A decrease in direct PAR, and increase in diffuse PAR (Moser
        et al. 2007),

    -   Increase in relative humidity (Foster 2001)

-   A decrease in above ground biomass with elevation

-   A decrease in LAI (Moser et al. 2007, Leuschner et al. 2007)

-   Generally, the foliar nutrient concentrations per dry weight biomass
    of phosphorus and nitrogen decline with altitude

-   Nitrogen content is generally correlated with photosynthetic
    capacity (Field and Mooney 1986, Evans 1989)

**How useful are species distribution models for managing biodiversity
under future climates?**

**Sinclair et al. 2010**

-   Synthesis of:

    -   Conceptual problems with species distribution models (SDMs)

        -   Interspecific interactions

        -   Dispersal

        -   Ecological equilibria

        -   Time lags

        -   Evolution

        -   Sampling of niche space

-   Projected SDMs have been successful in alerting us to the magnitude
    of climate change impacts but until they can offer insights that are
    more precise than what we can derive from basic ecological theory,
    how useful are they in deciding where to allocation scarce funds for
    large scale projects

-   Most commonly, SDMs use bioclimatic models

    -   Less common are those constructed from physiological
        measurements of organisms (Kearney et al. 2008)

-   Interspecific interactions

    -   Nearly all SDMs implicitly accept the classical niche concept:
        distributions of species are constrained by interactions with
        other organisms like competition and predation

    -   Despite the recognition that interspecific interactions are
        here, and are likely to change over time, SDMs almost never
        account for this

    -   Some assume that these effects will be unpredictable under
        climate change (Lewis 2006)

    -   Observations of organisms in nature will be, by definition,
        within the realised niche. When a model is eveloped using these
        recordsm all interspecific interactions are implicit (Davis
        et al. 1998b)

        -   But when the model is projected into the future, these
            effects are assumed to be equal

    -   Others have suggested that biotic interactions will be accounted
        for if models use mechanistic eleements rather than SDMs using
        correlation alone (Keith et al. 2008), Sutherherst et al. 2007

    -   As the important competitive interactions for many species are
        unknown or unsupported by spatial data it seems unlikely that
        SDMs incorporatingng interspecific interactions oculd be
        routinely produced for most species soon

-   Some environmental combinations will be novel

    -   (Walker & Steffen 1997)

-   Equilibria, time lags and historic accidents

    -   It is often assumed that species are in equilibrium with their
        environment

    -   This is implicit in models which use specie current ranges to
        extrapolate into the future

    -   In some cases, a species will not be at a location with a
        potentially suitable habitat because it physically cannot
        disperse there or is yet to arrive

    -   Other species occur in areas which they are not well suited to
        (Fitzpatrick et al. 2007)

        -   Adults may persist in areas even when conditions are no
            longer suitable for the establishment of young, especially
            in plants

    -   Other species will persist in habitat fragments that are too
        small or degraded to hold a species over the long term

        the introduction

-   Species mobility

    -   Some species move seasonally and do not experience the climate
        within their range for the entire year

-   Evolution and adaptation

    -   Some species may be able to evolve fast enough to alter their
        environmental requirements as the climate changes, particularly
        those with short generation times and diverse gene pools (Skelly
        et al. 2007)

    -   Species are made up of local populations which may be locally
        adapted to different portions of their range – individuals in
        one part may have a different genetic constitution to those in
        another part

-   Emigration capacity

    -   Species differ in their ability to disperse propagules to newly
        suitable range areas

    -   Those that have taken into account migration rate have often
        simplistically assumed 0 or full migration (Thomas et al. 2004)

    -   Really we need quantitative estimate of dispersability –
        distance, mode, frequency (Fitzpatrick et al. 2008)

-   Land use change

    -   Most SDMs predicting future climate change make bold but seldom
        stated assumptions about trends in human demography and land use

    -   Jetz et al. 2007 suggests that changed patterns of habitat
        fragmentation and connection are likely to have at least as
        large an impact as climate change in the medium term.

-   Incomplete sampling of niche space

    -   There is a tendency for higher smapling rates at more accessible
        locations – thus biasing estimations and predictions of species
        ranges

-   Causation v correlation

    -   Strong correlations may allow climate data to predict species
        occurrences even if climate has nothing to do with it (Lozier
        et al. 2009)

-   Scale mismatch

**Sensitivity of leaf size and shape to climate: global patterns and
palaeoclimatic applications**

**Peppe *et al.* 2011**

-   The authors quantify leaf-climate correaltions from 92 globally
    distributed, climatically diverse sites, and explore the potential
    confounding factors

-   Leaves in cold climates normally have larger more numerous teeth and
    are more highly dissected

    -   Leaf habit, local water availability and phylogenetic history
        affect these relationships

-   Leaves in wet climate have larger teeth, fewer small teeth

**Biotic and abiotic variables show little redundancy in explaining tree
species distributions**

**Meier *et al.* 2010**

-   SDMs normally don’t incorporate biotic interactions

    -   Therefore most predictions of species distributions under
        climate change assume that biotic interactions remain constant,
        or exert only minor influences on large-scale spatial
        distributions, which is also largely expected for species with
        high competitive ability

-   Exmained the extent to which variance explained by SDMs can be
    attributed to abiotic or biotic predictors and how this depends on

        -   Biotic, abiotic, combination

    -   Used variance partitioning to estimate the proportion of the
        variance explained by biotic and abiotic predictors jointly and
        independently

    -   Inclusion of biotic predictors improved the SDMs substantially

    -   The joint contribution nof abiotic and biotic predictors was
        relatively small, compared to the contribution of each predictor
        set individually (20% each)

    -   Indicating that the additional information on the realized niche
        brought by adding other species as predictors was largely
        independent of the abiotic (topo-climatic predictors)

**A significant upward shift in plant species optimum elevation during
the 20^th^ century**

**Lenoir *et al.* 2008**

-   Compared the altitudinal distribution of 171 forest plant species
    between 1905 and 1985, and 1986 and 2005 along an elevational
    gradient in W Europe

    -   Climate warming has resulted in a significant upward shift in
        species optimum elevation averaging 29 meters per decade

    -   The shift is larger for species restricted to mountain habitats
        and for grassy species, which are characterised by faster pop
        turnover

**Effects of size, competition and altitude on tree growth**

**Coomes & Allen 2007**

-   Competition for light has a strong influence on the growth of small
    trees whereas competition nfor nutrients affects trees of all sizes

**Neighbour effects on shrub seedling establishment override climate
change impacts in a Mediterranean community**

**Rysavy et al. 2016**

-   Species interactions can have a larger impact on plant performance
    than direct effects of climate change itself

-   Used field plots near Tel Aviv, Israel

-   Measured seedling survival of a dominant shrub species in response
    to the presence of herbaceous neighbours and to rainfall amount
    using 2 methods

    -   Space for time and studied seedling survival along an aridity
        gradient shown to mimic the protected rainfall changes

    -   Seedling survival in a common garden experiment which simulated
        drought conditions

    -   Neighbours always had a negative effect on shrub
        seedling survival. Contrary to theoretical predictions, the
        intensity of competition increased with reduction in
        water availability. Shrub seedlings originating from drier
        conditions showed higher survival

    -   Emphasises the importance of including biotic interactions in
        studies predicting changes in plant dynamics under
        climate change.

    -   Plant species growing in ecosystems prone to high rainfall
        variability showed a greater ability to cope with dry
        conditions, suggesting a more nuanced origin-specific prediction
        than suggested by recent climate models

**The importance of biotic interactions for modelling species
distributions under climate change**

**Araujo & Luoto 2007**

-   There is little empirical evidence that biotic interactions would
    not constrain species distributions at macro-ecological scales

-   Did a meta analysis of &gt;600 studies

-   Used Generalised Additive Modelling to investigate relationships
    between species and climate, species and hos plants, species and
    climate + host plants

-   Biotic interactions significantly affect both the explanatory and
    predictive power of bioclimatic envelope models at macro scales

-   Attempts to forecast climate-change impacts on biodiversity have
    often relied on the bioclimate envelope modelling approach, these
    models are criticised for not taking into account biotic
    interactions, especially interspecific competition (e.g. Davis
    et al. 1998, Leathwick 2002)

-   Davis et al. 1998 used a simple microcosm experiment including three
    fruit fly species to show the impact of interspecific competition on
    the distribution of species under simulated climate change

-   This study aims to scale up the experimental theory developed by
    these experiments

-   There is the risk that including species distrivutions as predictor
    variables in a model of another species might not truly reflect a
    biotic interaction but simply the absence of important environmental
    predictors in the model (Guisan & Thuiller 2005)

-   This study also did not use many other variable selection processes
    that may have further informed their model selection:

    -   Multi-model inference

    -   Boosting and model averaging,

    -   Shrinkage methods,

    -   Hierarchical partitioning couple with randomisation procedures

    -   See Araujo & New 2007

-   Despite this potential shortcoming this is the first study to
    explicitly address the consequences of incorporating simple biotic
    interaction terms for modelling species responses to climate change
    at macro-ecological scales

-   From a fundamental standpoint they support the conjecture that
    climate is the main determinant of species distributions at
    macro-ecological scales, although the companion idea that biotic
    interactions play a minor role is not fully supported

-   From an applied perspective, the results also stimulate questions
    about the appropriateness of making forecasts of species range
    shifts without taking into account relevant biotic interactions

**Predicting species distribution and abundance responses to climate
change: why it is essential to include biotic interactions across
trophic levels**

**Van der Putten et al. 2010**

-   The authors argue that the abundance of species and the direction of
    selection during climate change vary depending on how their trophic
    interactions become disrupted

-   Plant abundance can be controlled by aboveground and belowground
    multitrophic interactions with herbivores, pathogens, symbionts and
    their enemies

-   The authors suggest that conceptual analogies between species
    responses to climate waming an exotic species introduced in new
    ranges can be used

**A framework for community interactions under climate change**

**Gilman et al. 2010**

-   Interactions can strongly influence how climate chane affects
    organisms at every scale by altering their individual fitness,
    geographic ranges, and the structure and dynamics of their community

-   Failure to incorporate these interactions limits the ability to
    predict responses of species to climate change

-   Species interactions are among the most important forces structuring
    ecological communities and are commonly climate-dependent \[6-8\]

-   A recent review of &gt;600 stuies \[Aruato and lueto 2007\] found
    that climate change influenced virtually every type of species
    interaction, yet most models of climate effects on species ignore
    biotic interactions

-   It is unruprising therefore, that many such models produce
    inaccurate results, \[10-12\] Heikkinen, R.K. et al. (2007) but get
    better when they are included

-   As well as direct survival effects of temperature, it can also cause
    more subtle organismal or population changes

    -   Such changes can affect other memebers of a community via
        species interactions

    -   Chanfes in activity can modify encounter rates among species if
        indiciauls aovid exposure to stress or increase foraging to meet
        metabolic needs

-   A given abiotic change can differentially affect species in a
    community because each species has its own physiological optimum
    \[17 – lizards tho\] and experiences abiotic conditions differently
    \[21\]

**Climate change and the past, present, and future of biotic
interactions**

**Blois et al. 2013**

-   Biotic interactions drive key ecological and evolutionary processes
    and mediate ecosystem responses to climate change

-   The direction, frequency, and intensity of biotic interactions can
    in turn be altered by climate change

**The role of abiotic factors in community organization **

**Dunson & Travis 1991**

**Failure to migrate: lack of tree range expansion in response to
climate change**

**Zhu et al. 2012**

-   58.7% of the tree species examined show the pattern expected for the
    population

-   The fact that the majority of seedling extreme latitudes are less
    tha those for adult trees may emphasise the lack of evidence for
    climate-mediated migration, and should increase concerns for the
    risks posed by climate change
