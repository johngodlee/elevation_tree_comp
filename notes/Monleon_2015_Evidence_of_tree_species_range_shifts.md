# Evidence of tree species' range shifts in a complex landscape
## Monleon & Lintz 2015

### Background
* "Climate change is expected to change distribution of species"
* For sessile species such as trees, tracking warming climate depends on seedling colonization of new areas
* Attribution of drivers of range shifts can be challenging, because most studies examine shifts in either latitude or elevation, but those variables are surrogates for other variables (namely temperature) and neither latitude nor elevation have much biological meaning per se
* Observed changes could be caused by local effects that covary with elevation (disturbance, drought, land use change) rather than temperature (Fellows & Goulden 2012, Schwilk & Keeley 2011)
*
### Methods
* This study compares the distributions of seedlings and mature trees for all but rarest tree species on Western Seaboard of USA
	* 46 species (only the common ones, present in 25 plots or more)
	* 14,105 forest plots
	* Each plot was a cluster of 4 points in a 1 ha circle
		* At each point:
			* all trees DBH>12.7 cm within a 7.32 m radius were tallied
			* All trees 12.7<DBH>2.54 cm within a 2.07 m radius were tallied
			* All seedlings DBH`<`2.54 cm and length>=15.2cm(conifers)30.5cm(hardwoods) tallied in 2.07 m radius
				* Intended to exclude first year seedlings (v high mortality)
* As a surrogate for range shifts over time, they compare the distributions of mature trees and seedlings
	* A warmer climate implies that seedlings will be found in colder regions compared to mature trees 

### Results
* Mean annual temperature range of seedlings 0.12+/- 0.024 C colder than that of mature trees
* Mean elevation and latitude was higher for seedlings than mature trees
	* But within a species, the direction was often opposite for elevation and latitude, demonstrating a lack of direct biological relationship between species' distribution and these variables 
		* e.g. _Pinus monticola_ seedlings were at much lower elevations, but much higher latitudes than mature trees 
		* Shows that if the elevation and latitude trends were viewed separately, would lead to contradictory conclusions about their resposne to climate change
