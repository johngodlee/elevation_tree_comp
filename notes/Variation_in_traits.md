***The relationship between shading and photosynthesis***

**Effects of shade treatment on photosynthetic capacity, chlorophyll
fluorescence, and chlorophyll content of Tetrastigma hemsleyanum Diels
et Gilg**

**Dai et al. 2009**

-   Plant grown under full sunlight and moderate and high levels of
    shade

-   Attained greatest leaf size when grown under 67% shade

-   Leaves of seedling grown with 90% shade were the smallest

-   Net photosynthetic rate = P~n~, highest for the 67% shade treatment

-   Light saturation point for the 67% treatment was 600umol / m2 / s

-   Chla and Chlb content increased and Chla/b values decreased
    (more chla) with increased shading

-   Light intensity with shade &lt;50% depressed photosynthetic activity
    and growth

-   The species is best suited to shady and moist hillsides in Southern
    China

**Acclimation of photosynthesis to irradiance and spectral quality in
British plant species: chlorophyll content, photosynthetic capacity and
habitat preference**

**Murchie & Horton 1997**

**The effects of droughts and shade on the performance, morphology and
physiology of Ghanaian tree species**

**Amissah *et al.* 2015**

-   In tropical forests light and water availability are the most
    important factors for seedling growth and survival but an increasing
    frequency of drought may affect regeneration

-   Shade enhances plant performance through improved microclimatic
    conditions, rejecting the tradeoff hypothesis tht drought should
    have stronger impact in shade due to reduced root investment

-   Shaded plants had low biomass fraction in roots

-   Within species shade and drought tolerances are not in tradeoff, but
    largely uncoupled

-   Measured:

-   Height, diameter, leaf area, stem length, root length, no. leaves,
    leaf weight, growth rate

-   Light had the strongest effect on seedlings, affecting 11/12 traits

-   Considerably less significant interactions between light and water

-   Shade led to an increase in allocation to leaves, increased
    production of thin and or soft leaves, increased leafiness
    (analogous to Height:Leaf Ratio)

**The Scaling relationships between leaf mass an leaf area of vadcular
plant species change with altitude**

**Pan et al. 2013**

-   Leaf dry mass and leaf surface area are two important leaf traits

-   What is the relationship between SLA (Specific leaf area = Area per
    leaf mass) and leaf area?

-   Several studies have shown that as leaves increase in mass,
    increases in area often fail to keep pace (a&gt;1). But the opposite
    has also been found, where SLA increases with leaf size.

    -   Both occur due to different biomass distribution between
        productive and supportive tissues in large compared to small
        leaves

    -   It was also found that leaf mass scales isometrically to leaf
        area (a=1)

-   Within leaves, we can divide structures broadly into:
    petiole (support) and lamina (productive) tissues

-   Plant growth rate scales positiviely with the mass fraction in leaf
    lamina, and is negatively associated with the fraction of support
    tissues \[7\].

-   Environmental factors may influence the relationsgip between M
    and A.

    -   Optimal allocation theory predicts that plants should invest
        more biomass to the compartment that acquires the most limiting
        resource to adapt to environmental changes \[13\].

        -   E.g. in windy environments, larger leaves may increase the
            proportion of biomass allocation to lamina support tissues
            to provide sufficient mechanical stability.

-   Leaf size has important consequences dor the scale and precision
    with which plants forage for light

    -   Large leaves at low light intensities may intercept a large
        amount of light due to their more extensive foliar display,
        whereas small leaves are better able to exploit fine-grained
        environmental heterogeneity by positioning their leaves in
        light-rich micropatches \[26\]

**Effects of canopy structure on resource availability and seedling
responses in a longleaf pine ecosystem**

**Palik et al. 1997**

-   Competition between between mature trees and regeneration has been
    well studied in closed canopy forests

-   Examined the longleaf pine

-   Understand the effects of overstory abundance on resource
    availability and seedling responses to resource levels

-   Examined resources and seedling performance across a gradient of
    canopy covers

-   Seedling growth increased slowly across a wide range of decreasing
    overstory basal area, but increased substantially only in the centre
    of gaps.

-   Seedling survival was unrelated to overstory abundance

-   Overstory basal area (DBH equivalent) was negatively related to
    light and nitrogen.

-   Nitrogen only increased in the centre of gaps, suggesting that
    below-ground and above ground gaps are spatially distinct

-   The data suggest that an increase in both light and nitrogen may be
    required for seedling growth increase.

**Effects of above and below ground competition on growth and survival
of rain forest tree seedlings**

**Lewis & Tanner 2000**

-   Trenching around tree seedlings in a rainforest, approximately
    doubled the height growth of the understory

-   Both species significantly increased allocation to leaves and
    decreased allocation to roots in response to trenching. The
    increased growth in the wet season caused by trenching and increased
    foliar nitrogen and phosphorus amount, showed that both species were
    probably competing with afult trees for nutrients as well as PAR.

-   Phosphorus did not limit growth, however we could not deduce which
    nutrient did limit groth.

-   Given that 60-70% of world’s tropical rain forests occur on
    low-fertility oxisols, intense adult-juvenile competition both above
    and below ground may be the norm

-   Plants are likely to compete for three things:

    -   Water

    -   Nutrients

    -   PAR

-   The results of trenching experiments are inconsistent:

    -   Denslow et al. 1991, Ostertag 1998, Grubb unpublished, found no
        effect

-   Studies done on different soil types suggest that on nutrient poor
    soils, seedlings compete with adult trees for nutrients

-   If trenching (reduced competition) did increase nutrient
    availability, such increased slopes and maximum rates of
    photosynthesis would allow seedlings in trenched plots to increase
    their carbon acquisition by taking greater advantage of sunflecs

**Gaps and root trenching increase tree seedling growth in panamanian
semi-evergreen forest**

**Barberis & Tanner 2005**

-   Trenching in gaps increased growth in three species but had very
    small effects in the understory

-   Trenching did not affect mortality

-   Trenching caused increased growth due to increased nutrients in the
    wet season, an increased water and/or nutrients in the dry season.

-   Across the tropics, in all but the wettest sites with fertile soils,
    seedlings of many species will be limited by belowground competition

-   Wright 2002 – seedlings mostly compete with mature vegetation.

-   Gaps increased growth and decreased mortality much more than
    trenching

-   Gaps increased growth in all four species, while trenching increased
    growth in ¾ species

-   The height and mean leaf area for seedlings after 1 year of growth
    showed that trenching increased leaf area and height slightly, but
    gap and trench increased it a lot, more than just gap or just trench

-   Light limitation is greater than nutrient limitation and masks the
    effects of nutrient limitation

-   On very infertile arenosols in rain foest in Venezuela, trenching
    increased seedling height growth by 52%

    -   On more fertile soils in panama, they found that trenching only
        increased growth by 35%

**Weak competition among tropical tree seedlings: Implications for
species coexistence**

**Paine et al. 2008**

-   Intense competition among seedlings could allow competitively
    dominant species to exclude subordinate species

    -   Alternatively, the low density and small stature of forest tree
        seedlings could preclude intense interseedling competition. In
        which case, size-asymmetric competition with adults would
        prevail as those structuring understory distributions

-   Individual growth rates were generally unrelated to stem density

-   Seedling ZOIs overlapped only slightly in extremely dense
    monodominant plots, and even less in ambient density plots of
    mixed composition.

-   Results suggest:

    -   Interseedling competition is weak,

    -   Given the low density of tree seedlings in Neotropical forests,
        it is inferred that resource competition may be irrelevant to
        recruitment

-   Whether competition occurs only between seedlings and adults or
    additionally between seedlings of similar size has important
    ramifications for forest regeneration and the maintenance of species
    diversity

    -   If competition is predominantly seedling-Adult, then the
        seedling species identity would be fairly unimportant to
        individual performace, because seedlings would not compete among
        themselves for resources (Lewis and Tanner 2000, Barberis &
        Tanner 2005)

    -   But if seedlings of relatively similar sizes compete instensely
        among themselves, then the identity of neighbouring seedlings
        may be an additional, ciritical determinant of individual
        performance

-   There is abundant evidence that shading by saplings and adults
    reduces the growth and survival of forest tree seedlings through
    above and belowground competition

**Relationships between leaf chlorophyll content and spectral
reflectance and algorithms for non-destructive chlorophyll assessment in
high plant leaves**

**Gitelson et al. 2003**

-   The chlorophylls (A and B) are essential pigments for the conversion
    of light energy to stored chemical energy

-   Chlorophyll content can directly determine photosynthetic potential
    and primary production (Curran et al. 1990, Filella et al. 1995).
    Additionaly, Chl gives n estimation of the nutrient status of the
    plant because much of the leaf nitrogen is incorporated in
    chlorophyll (Filella et al. 1995, Moran et al. 2000). Furthermore,
    leaf chlorophyll content is related to plant stress and senescence
    (Hendry 1987, Merzylan & Gitelson 1995, Penuelas & Filela 1998,
    Mmerzlyak 1999)

**Evaluation of Chlorophyll content, and fluorescence parameters as
Indicators of drought tolerance in Barley**

**Rong-hua LI et al. 2006**

-   The values of chlorophyll content were significantly higher in
    drought tolerant genotypes than those drought sensitive genotpyes
    when subjected to stress.

**Visible and near-infrared reflectance techniques for diagnosing plant
physiological status**

**Penuelas & Filella 1998**

-   There is a close correlation between leaf chlorophyll concentration
    and nitrogen availability, and thus reflectance assessment of
    chlorophyll can also be used to characterise the nitrogen status of
    vegetation and crops.

**The effect of tree height and light availability on photosynthetic
leaf traits of four Neotropical species differing in shade tolerance**

**Rijkers et al.2000**

-   Measured A~max~, Nitrogen, Chl content, LMA - in leaves of trees of
    different heights along a natural light gradient in a French Guiana
    rain forest

-   Light availability was measured using LAI

-   Pioneer species had the lowest LMA and lead N

-   It is expected that plants would be quite plastic in their ability
    to adjust leaf traits over time, as light regime in a tropical
    forest is heterogeneous over time, as canopy closes and opens

-   Kitajima 1994, Bongers & Popma 1988 show that shade leaves have
    higher mass based chlorophyll content.

-   Sun leaves often make more efficient use of the prevailing high
    light intensities for carbon gain while avoiding a possible
    reduction in Photosynthetic performance as a result of
    photoinhibition

    -   Acclimation to a high light condition often results in thicker
        leaves with more chloroplasts per unit area, greater incestments
        in leaf compounds related to the carboxylation and electron
        transport processes needed to increase Photosynthetic
        capacity (e.g. Boardman1977)

**Plasticity in leaf traits of 38 tropical tree species in response to
light; relationships with light demand and adult stature**

**Rozendaal et al. 2006**

-   Species differed significantly in all leaf traits, which explained a
    large part of the observed variation (average R^2^ = 0.72)

-   Chlorophyll content increased in the shade leaves, with a higher
    Chl:N in shade leaves. Indicating that a greater proportion of leaf
    N was invested in chlorophyll for light capture at th expense of
    investment in Rubisco
