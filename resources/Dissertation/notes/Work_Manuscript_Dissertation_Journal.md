# Which Journal?
* Things to consider:
	* Fit
	* Fees
	* Open Access
	* Impact Factor
	* Invite-Only?
	
* Possible journals (Elsevier match %)
	* Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics - 100%
		* Longer research articles that provide a broad understanding of key topics
		* Empirical papers from long-term ecological research sites (LTER)
		* 6 issues per year
		* If want to b open access then pay extra
		* citation in text
		* supplementary material allowed with no formatting from editors
		* Recent Articles:
			* Impact of climate extremes modulated by species characteristics and richness
			* Interactions between a root hemiparasite and 27 different hosts: Growth, biomass allocation and plant architecture
			* Environmental heterogeneity drives fine-scale species assembly and functional diversity of annual plants in a semi-arid environment
		
	* Environmental and Experimental Botany
		* Research papers on the physical, chemical, biological, molecular mechanisms and processes involved in the responses of plants to their environment. 
			* i. Global change impacts on plant ecophysiology
			* ii. Biotic interactions involving environmental factors. 
			* iii. Preferably providing evidence of new mechanisms underlying plant stress resistance 
			
	* Annals of Forest Science
		* Topics include ecology and ecophysiology, genetics and improvement, tree physiology, wood quality, and silviculture
		* Forest dynamics and ecosystem processes under environmental or management drivers (ecology, genetics
		
	* Functional Ecology
		* 12 times a year
		* Research papers that enable a mechanistic understanding of ecological pattern and process from the organismic to the ecosystem scale
		* The results should have broad conceptual significance, and not just be of significance for the focal species or small group of species
		
	* Modeling Earth Systems and Environment
		* ~10-12 pages
		* Could do a "Data Article"
		
	* Journal of Theoretical Biology (Similar papers)
		* Must bear significant importance on the biology being presented, and not on the mathematical analysis, per se. 
		* clearly give insight into biological processes. The biological significance should be clearly stated. 
		
	* Landscape Ecology (Similar papers)
		* Flows and redistributions of organisms, materials, and energy in landscape mosaics
		* Landscape connectivity and fragmentation
		* Innovative methods in landscape analysis and modeling
	
	* Forest Ecology and Management - 52%
		* publishes scientific articles linking forest ecology with forest management 
		* focusing on the application of biological, ecological and social knowledge to the management and conservation of plantations and natural forests. 
		
	* Global Environmental Change - 36% 
		
	* Plant Biology [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1438-8677]
		* Check impact factor, herbivory paper from the transect was published there
		* Problem-oriented short research papers (maximum five typeset pages)
			* These will be given higher priority for publishing
		* One typeset page in the journal (without figures and tables, with about 3 subheads and paragraphs) usually contains roughly 6200 characters
		* Manuscripts must be of general interest, not only addressed to a specialized readership. The journal encourages publications with an interdisciplinary approach.

		
Look at some specifically tropical 

Maybe send an abstract to an editor of a journal and ask about suitability
