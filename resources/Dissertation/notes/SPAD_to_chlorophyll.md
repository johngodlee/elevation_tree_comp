Calculating Chlorophyll content from SPAD

**Evaluating the relationship between leaf chlorophyll concentration and
SPAD-502 chlorophyll meter readings**

**Uddling et al. 2007**

-   For all species, slope increased with SPAD

-   Some species had good predictability, some bad

-   Potato, wheat, birch

-   

**Relationship between specific leaf area, leaf thickness, leaf water
content, and SPAD-502 readings in six Amazonian tree species**

**Marenco et al. 2009**

-   Effects of:

    -   SLA

    -   Leaf succulence

    -   Specific leaf mass

    -   Leaf water conten

-   On chlorophyll meter values

-   6 Amazzonian tree species

-   Also tested the accuracy of a general SPAD to Chl calibration
    equarion

-   Chl content predicted by the general equation differed
    significantly (P&lt;.01) from that of the species specific equations

-   CONCLUDE: lead thickness and LWC should be taken into account

-   INTRO

    -   Chl content relates directly to the amount of light absorbed by
        a plant, it can also be indicative of the light environment
        during growth, e.g. Chl a:b is lower in shade leaves than sun
        leaves

-   The all species equation is:

    -   $Chl = 0.53e^{\begin{matrix}
        0.0364 \times SPAD \\
         \\
        \end{matrix}}$

    -   R^2^ = 0.70 p&lt;0.01

**Assessing foliar chlorophyll contents with the SPAD-502 chlorophyll
meter: a calibration test with thirteen tree species of tropical
rainforest in French Guiana**

**Coste *et al.* 2010**

-   The homographic model most accurately predicts the total chlorophyll
    content from SPAD (R^2^ = 0.89)

    -   Interspecific differences un the homographic model parameters
        explain &lt;7% of the variation in the chlorophyll content in
        the data

-   Tested the accuracy using AIC

-   Tested ability ot predict unseen data, using a cross-validation
    technique

-   Adding a species effect increased the R^2^ to 0.96

-   $Chl = \left( \alpha \times SPAD \div \left( \beta - SPAD \right) \right)$

    -   Where a = 117.10 +/- 6.53, and B = 148.84 +/- 8.69

-   Most species specific model iterations diverged at high SPAD values

-   Some measurements were biased due to measuring along the veins
