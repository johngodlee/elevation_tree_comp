# Abstract

# Overview
* Introduction
	* Tropical trees are shifting upslope and they will encounter changes as they move in environment
	* It is important to predict their movement because...
	* The majority of models predicting upslope movement don't do it very well, they often over-estimate the rate of upslope migration
	* This might be because they don't include things that vary with elevation like forest structure- LiDAR paper
	* Previous studies have suggested that species could be limited by changes in biotic environment
	* Seedlings experiencing higher levels of stress are less likely to survive to be able to recruit new individuals
	* Seedlings can also show acclimation to environment by changing their morphology
	* In this study we investigated whether seedlings were experiencing physiological stress or acclimating to environmental conditions, along their elevational ranges.
	* If species are experiencing more stress upslope then we can suggest that they might not be able to move as predicted by bioclimatic envelope models
	* Hypotheses:  
	
* Materials and Methods
	* Study site
	* Species
	* Physiology
	* Morphology
	* Forest structure
	* Statistical analysis (cut this down compared to diss.)
	
* Results
	* A decrease in canopy cover with elevation causes an increase in plant stress (Fv/Fm)
	* But a decrease in stand density with elevation causes a decrease in plant stress (Fv/Fm)
	* The density of other seedlings didn't vary meaningfully across elevation and didn't make a difference to plant stress
	* In general plant stress decreased with elevation!! CONTRADICTION
	* Morphology - a general shift towards more stem and less leaf
		* Leaf thickness and stem volume increased with elevation
		* Leaf area decreased with elevation
	* The best models to predict plant stress, leaf thickness, and leaf area all included elevation, canopy cover and stand density, but not seedling density 
	* Species differed in their responses to forest structural change with elevation
	
* Discussion
	* Recap of key results
		* 
	* Stress response
		* Plant stress increases as the canopy thins - Less constant micro-climate, cavitation, UV-B damage
		* Plant stress increases as the stand becomes more dense - Reduction in available nutrients - is this effect seen because of an increase in nutrient availability at high elevation?
		* Seedling density had no effect on stress levels - Others confirm this 
	* Morphological response
		* Leaf thickness increases as the canopy thins - Less thick cuticle to protect against UV-B
		* Plants become less leafy with thicker stems as the stand becomes more dense - higher windspeeds, less allocation to leaves, slower growth
	* Conclusion and future research
		* This study shows that as the forest structure changes at high elevation, plants experience more stress, potentially lowering their overall fitness
		* This study shows that as the forest structure changes at high elevation, plants allocate less biomass towards leaf apparatus and more to structural integrity and defense, potentially leading to slower growth and lower fitness.
		* Future studies should perform experiments, taking seedlings out of their ranges and seeing whether that influences their survival rate.

# Questions for 14:00Tue14Feb2017

* The variance explained by the fixed effects in my models was small, less than 25% in most cases, does this matter?
* Stand density decreases with elevation, lowering stress, going against the basic idea of the paper, what do I do?
* How should I redesign the figures? Should I be including figures showing how each species' traits varies with each competition variable? That would be 18 graphs, unless I could combine them

at height, will grow slowly anyway, because of low temperature 

partition into lowland forest and upland forest

make clear partition between elevation model component saying decrease with elevation and model component with just competition variables
