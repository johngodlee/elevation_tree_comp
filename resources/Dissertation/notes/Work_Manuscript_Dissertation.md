Work - Manuscript - Dissertation

# APs:
* Read through dissertation and take notes
* Write first draft: [[Work - Manuscript - Dissertation - Plant Biology Skeleton V2]] [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1438-8677]

# Questions about content:
* Do I take elevation out of it completely and just focus on testing physiological indicators of stress on competition?
	* I thought the overall effect of elevation was a good thing to compare my results to in terms of effect size
	* Should control for the effect of elevation in the analysis, as many other things covary with elevation.
		* How do I include elevation in an `lmer()` to control for its effect on the response variable, isolating the interesting effect?
* Repeat analysis giving each species a random slope? 
	* You wouldn't expect species to have identical slopes of elevation vs. physiology
* Correlation ≠ causation
	* Observed increase in Fv/Fm with elevation doesn't mean that was the cause
 * Think about partitioning into lowland forest and upland forest in analysis

# Story
* 3 main aspects of the project:
	* Do species exhibit stress responses to changes in competition regime? - Not acclimating
	* Do species change morphology in response to changes in competition regime? - Acclimating
	* Do species differ in their ability to respond?
* Physiological indicators of plant stress seem to show that lower competition at higher elevations will allow species to move upslope, so competition isn't limiting range shifts
* Physiological indicators of plant stress do change a bit because of changes in competition regime
	* Competition interactions are going to have an effect on recruitment as species move as a result of climate change?
	


#######################DONE#######################
* Pick a Journal - Decided on Plant Biology - small paper (max 5 pages) [[Work - Manuscript - Dissertation - Journal]]
* Redo data analysis, classifying each species as lowland or upland - is the fit improved?
* Next meeting on the 14th at 14:00 //
* Develop a skeleton for Plant Biology short paper  (Title, abstract, Bullet point outline) //
	* [[Work - Manuscript - Dissertation - Plant Biology Skeleton]] //

* # Potential overlap with Pippa - solved
* I will not use leaf traits (SLA, SPAD etc.) in the same way as her, I am focussing on whole plant morphology as a way of indicating acclimation
	* Might not use SPAD at all because the data was so dodge for the seedlings
* I will not be getting into the nitty gritty of the Fv/Fm measurements
* I will not be getting into the adults measurements
* Would forest structure be a better term than competition? - YES //
* Do I do extra analysis to predict how species will move? //
	* No, treat this paper as providing preliminary data that someone else can do fancy models with //
