# Potential Questions

* Dispersal limitation as a barrier to upslope migration?  Often cited as a reason for latitudinal range shifts not being as strong as expected
	*  I think the difference is that the trees here aren't dispersal limited, they are normally dispersed by birds and mammals rather than wind

* What are variance inflation factors?
	* VIF quantifies the severity of collinearity between variables that were used in the model

* What are pseudo-r-squared values?
	* A normal R^2 is a statistic generated by an Ordinary least squares regression.
	* But there isn't an equivalent for linear mixed models, and it is especially unreliable for Generalised linear mixed models

* Why did you expect that chlorophyll content would be affected by biotic environment?

* Same time same day? Why expect chlorophyll fluorescence to to indicate lifetime success?
