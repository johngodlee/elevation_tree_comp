# Notes on Pippa's Comments - 2019_10_28

Add info on cloud zone environment in methods. 

Email Patrick for comments and to ask about use of ABERG data in the paper

Confirm linear model form for equation

Add more values in results, minima and maxima, means, etc.

Reference FIgure 9 more, it contains the important results

Fewer figures in total

Figure 11 needs more explanation

More interpretation of mixed models to make it easier for the reader.

Simplify the overall message of the paper. Dwell on main findings only.

Reiterate hypotheses at start of the discussion.

Maybe drop chlorophyll content from the analysis completely, the data from it is pretty shite.

look in Pippa's thesis for the species specific information

# Notes on Pippa's thesis

> over a 25 year period, cloud frequency has tended to decrease and drought intensity has tended to increase in the lowlands at the base of the Andes (Halladay et al. 2012).

> Upslope shifts in communities were mainly driven by mortality at the lower range edge and were slowed by limitations to dispersal, establishment and growth at the upper range edge (Feeley et al. 2011, 2013, Duque et al. 2015). Ranges are contracting from the lower range edge without exapansion at the upper range edge.

Many tropical species exist close to their temperature optimum. This means that when temperature increases they can't acclimate. Tropical species often aren't plastic because they never experience wide environmental conditions.

Shade leaves increase SLA, sun leaves are thicker, with more nutrients per unit leaf area (Poorter et al. 2009).

Where stress is greatest, traits are expected to be most conservative (lower SLA, higher thickness, higher nutrients) (Loehle 1998, Wright et al. 2004, Read et al. 2014, Vitasse et al. 2014).

There is a tendency towards more conservative traits with elevation. This makes montane species less able to respond to climate change than lowland species as they are less able to compete with acquisitive fast growing species that may migrate into their habitat (Way and Oren 2010).

> Based on historic range shifts in response to changing climate, montane species have previously been replaced by upslope encroachment of lower-elevation species during warmer and drier time periods (Bush et al. 2004, Colwell et al. 2008, Morueta-Holme et al. 2015).

Environmental variation with elevation increase:

* Decreased atmospheric pressure
* Decreased temperature (environmental lapse rate 5C km^-1) (Malhi et al. 2016)
* Increased radiation with clear skies
* Increased UV-C relative to solar radiation. (Liley and McKenzie 2006)

There is an abrupt change at the transition between lowland and montane forest (1500-2000 m):

* Geology
* Soil
* slope
* radiation

My species are classed as:

* AV - TMCF - Wind
* CR - TMCF - Wind
* CT - TMCF - Birds
* HG - TMCF - Birds
* MS - TMCF - Birds
* SP - TMCF - Birds
* TG - LMF  - Birds and mammals

AV, CT, HG have succulent traits.

CT is hemi-epiphytic

TCMF species appear to be at a competitive disadvantage to LMF species. Maybe species with highly succulent leaf traits (e.g. AV, __CT__, HG) are unable to compete with LMF species which have more responsive and acquisitive traits (Valladares and Niinemets 2008, Nicotra et al. 2010).

TCMF species had a greater variability in SLA than LMF species in a transplant experiment.
