Add info on cloud zone environment in methods. 

Email Patrick for comments and to ask about use of ABERG data in the paper

Confirm linear model form for equation

Add more values in results, minima and maxima, means, etc.

Reference FIgure 9 more, it contains the important results

Fewer figures in total

Figure 11 needs more explanation

More interpretation of mixed models to make it easier for the reader.

Simplify the overall message of the paper. Dwell on main findings only.

Reiterate hypotheses at start of the discussion.

Maybe drop chlorophyll content from the analysis completely, the data from it is pretty shite.

look in Pippa's thesis for the species specific information
