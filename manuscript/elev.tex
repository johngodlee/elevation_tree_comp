\section{Introduction}
Rapid anthropogenic climate change is causing many species, across a wide range of taxa, to shift their distributions in space \citep{Chen2011, Hughes2000, Parmesan2006}. The primary forces driving this are an increase in temperature and changes in precipitation regime \citep{Corlett2013, McCain2011}. \citet{Chen2011} estimates that globally, across a range of taxonomic groups, species are experiencing mean latitudinal and altitudinal migration rates of 17.6 $\pm$ 2.9 km and 12.2 $\pm$ 1.8 m per decade, respectively. Previous studies have suggested that the ability of species to respond to changes in mean annual temperature and precipitation regime will be important in determining species success over the coming century \citep{Colwell2008, Chen2011, Feeley2012}. 

Species responses to climate change may occur either in the form of adaptation, \textit{i.e.} changes in phenology, physiology and morphology, or through range shifts over space \citep{Bellard2012}. Range shifts have been observed in many studies across the world, particularly in temperate, sub-arctic and montane regions where temperature change is the most extreme \citep{Lenoir2015}. The number of studies documenting adaptational responses to climate change are fewer, potentially indicating that climate change is occurring so rapidly as to prevent effective adaptational responses \citep{Mantyka2012}. Range shift rates vary between species depending on their sensitivity to climate and their fecundity, which affects rate of recruitment into newly suitable areas \citep{MacLean2017, Travis2013}. This asynchronicity has the potential to create novel species assemblages as species ranges overlap more or less as they shift at different rates, with unknown consequences for ecosystem functionality \citep{Hobbs2009}. Predicting range shifts across space has become an active field of research, (see \citealt{Bellard2012} and references therein), and is being used as a tool to inform conservation strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem functionality \citep{Dawson2011}.

The majority of species distribution models used to predict species range shifts as a conservation tool have used bioclimatic envelopes to constrain species ranges \citep{Pearson2003, Sinclair2010}. Bioclimatic envelopes are constructed by correlating current species range extent with observed environmental conditions within those boundaries, then projecting spatially explicit climate trends into the future under different climate change scenarios to predict how species range boundaries will adjust in response (e.g. \citealt{Araujo2006, Berry2002, Peterson2002, Thuiller2005}). These models have been criticised often for being overly simplistic, especially when applied at the local scale \citep{McMahon2011}, where other factors that have not been considered by the bioclimatic envelope model become important limiting factors for range shifts. Such factors include unmeasured environmental variables, physical factors such as topography, and biotic interactions with other species \citep{Davis1998, Ettinger2011, Putten2010}.

When range shifts in a rapidly changing climate are driven by a single environmental variable like mean annual temperature, it is possible that a species will move into an area that is sub-optimal in other ways than those predicted by the model if range shifts outstrip acclimatory/adaptive potential. Range shifts into sub-optimal habitats may lead to reductions in local abundance and/or species richness \citep{Colwell2008}, changes in community composition \citep{Gibson-Reinemer2015}, ecosystem functioning \citep{Bellard2012}, and ecosystem service provision that are not predicted by bioclimatic envelope models \citep{Dobson2011, Isbell2011}. In order to accurately predict range shifts and their consequences for future ecosystem assembly, it is important that predictive range models be expanded to include variables which describe habitat as well as climate \citep{Wisz2013}.

For sessile taxa such as trees, range shifts occur as a result of differential recruitment and mortality over space, at the leading and trailing edges of their range \citep{Corlett2013}. In communities of long-lived tree species however, the forest ecosystem may not shift in equilibrium with the climate as individuals are resilient to gradual changes in climate, developing large root systems and below-ground water and nutrient reserves to buffer against stressful conditions; adult trees may persist where more sensitive seedlings perish \citep{Bell2014, Lenoir2009}. As tree seedlings recruit upslope into areas that are newly suitable in terms of temperature, they will encounter novel biotic environments consisting of canopy trees which first recruited into the area when the climate was different. Forest trees, particularly those in moist tropical forests, often experience high levels of mortality during the seedling recruitment stage, creating a key demographic bottleneck that can impact a species' success, potentially limiting upslope migration \citep{Coomes2000}. Seedling growth is affected by shade regimes created by adult tree canopy gaps. There is abundant evidence that shading from adult tree canopies reduces seedling growth rate and thus increases the probability of seedling mortality, with tropical forest tree seedlings frequently growing into canopy gaps \citep{Valladares2016}. Additionally however, seedlings of many tropical tree species are highly adapted to shade \citep{Matsubara2009}, meaning that if a seedling germinates under an open space in the canopy, especially in the tropics at a higher elevation, where UV-B intensity is high, mortality by UV-B and heat damage to photosynthetic machinery is quite probable \citep{Krause2001, Li2010}. Many species found at high altitudes have specific adaptations to avoid UV-B damage to photosynthetic machinery, such as vertically stacked palisade mesophyll cells and thick cuticles to reduce UV-B absorption, and generally smaller thicker leaves \citep{Prado2012}. Species found at low altitudes however, are less adapted to high UV-B environments, instead possessing adaptations to make the most of the diminished light levels found under thick tree canopy, particularly during the seedling growth stage. If seedlings germinate in areas that have a different overstorey shade regime and forest structural type to that which they are adapted to grow in, damage may occur leading to loss of photosynthetic capacity, reducing growth rates and occasionally resulting in seedling mortality. 

Montane forest physical structure varies with elevation. Lowland forests often have lower tree density, with relatively few young trees in the light-deprived understorey, but a higher canopy cover \citep{}. Herbaceous plant cover is generally greater at higher altitudes, with many epiphytic and ground-level species \citep{Martin2010}. Tree seedlings moving upslope may therefore compete with existing trees and herbaceous flora for nutrients and rootspace, although there is some separation between seedling and adult tree rooting depths for most species \citep{Lewis2000}, especially for the largest trees. These factors which act as limitations to upslope migration of tree species in tropical montane forests may lead to species' ranges narrowing from the bottom up, with increased mortality due to temperature at the bottom of the elevational range, but without increased recruitment at the top end of the elevational range \citep{}. This seedling mortality bottleneck provides a limiting factor to the success of montane tropical forest tree species experiencing range shifts and raises concern for their conservation as keystone species of these highly biodiverse ecosystems.

Andean forests are experiencing warming of between 0.1 °C and 0.6 °C per decade \citep{Marengo2011, Vuille2015} with predicted increases in air temperature of between +1.7\textdegree{}C to +6.7\textdegree{}C by 2100 \citep{Magrin2014}. In response to these shifts in climate, the Andes has been projected to experience species turnover of 90\% over the next century. However, not all species follow a predictable upslope migrational trend. In montane tropical forests generally, \textapprox{}25\% of species showing a downslope movement and \textapprox{}10\% showing no movement \citep{Lenoir2010}.

In this study, along a moist tropical forest elevational gradient in the Peruvian Andes, we investigated the role of biotic effects from existing forest structure on the physiology and physiognomy of tree seedlings across their elevational ranges, in order to increase our knowledge of the dynamics of montane cloud forest tree species elevational range shifts. We tested three hypotheses: H\textsubscript{1}) Within a species, seedlings growing at higher elevations would experience higher levels of photosynthetic stress than those at lower elevations, H\textsubscript{2}) Species would differ in their degree of acclimation to variation in adult tree forest structure, and H\textsubscript{3}) A combination of biotic and abiotic explanatory variables would best explain variation in seedling physiognomic and physiological traits across their elevational range.

\section{Materials and Methods}
\subsection{Study Site}
Data collection was conducted across 10 permanent 1 ha forest plots in the Kos\~{n}ipata Valley of Man\'{u} National Park, Peru (-13\textdegree N, -71\textdegree W, Figure \ref{sites}, Table \ref{site_char}). The Kos\~{n}ipata Valley has been identified as a migration corridor for lowland species to migrate to higher elevations in response to temperature increase \citep{Feeley2011} and so is an appropriate location to study range shift drivers (Figure \ref{mig}). Plots are situated between 800 and 3200 m elevation along this migration corridor (Table \ref{site_char}, Figure \ref{ranges}). The plots form part of a larger plot network established by the Andes Biodiversity and Ecosystem Research Group (ABERG) in 2003 \citep{Malhi2010, Girardin2014}, and are located within the Tropical Andes biodiversity hotspot identified in \citet{Myers2000}. The plots used in this study contain 719 tree species, and the valley as a whole contains an estimated 1167 tree species (ABERG unpublished data).

\subsection{Study species} 
We chose seven tree species for comparison from a total of 719 identified species within the 9 study plots. Species were selected according to their contrasting ranges (Figure \ref{ranges}), differences in genus migratory pattern \citep{Feeley2011} (Figure \ref{mig}), and because each species is dominant across it's range in the Kos\~{n}ipata Valley (ABERG, unpublished data) (Figure \ref{rank_abund}). Seedlings of \textit{Myrcia} spp. (MS) are difficult to reliably identify to species in the field due to similar morphology and were instead sampled as a composite of three potential species: \textit{Myrcia splendens}, \textit{M. fallax}, and \textit{M. rostrata}, the only \textit{Myrcia} species known to be present in our plots from previous ABERG censuses. They are referred to as \textit{Myrcia spp.} from here onwards. 

% Despite having no quantitative range shift prediction information, \textit{Iriartea deltoidea} and \textit{Dictyocaryum lamarckianum} were included in order to observe potential differences in response between monocot and dicot species, as both are monocots. Both \textit{I. deltoidea} and \textit{D. lamarckianum} are large-seeded palm species, as such, they are expected to be migrating upslope, similar to other large-seeded palms \citep{Hillyer2010}.

\subsection{Sampling and Measurement}
Species were sampled in three plots representing the top, middle and bottom elevational extents of their elevational ranges (Figure \ref{ranges}). Within each plot, a maximum of 10 seedlings were sampled. To minimise the chance of pseudo-replication of sampled seedlings, seedlings closer than 10 m to another sampled seedling were excluded from the analysis, as it could not be guaranteed that the stems were not connected by a stolon or rhizome. It also ensured that canopy layer structural measurements were truly independent. Within a cluster of seedlings within 5 m of each other, each seedling was assigned a number and a random number generator was used to choose a single seedling for measurement.

Proxies for photosynthetic capacity were measured on the highest fully-expanded leaf of each seedling to assess seedling stress. Seedlings under physiological stress may deactivate or lose chlorophyll photo-centres, lowering photosynthetic capacity. Chl\textsubscript{$\alpha$} fluorescence was measured to estimate photosynthetic capacity using a Walz Mini-PAM II (Walz Effeltrich, Germany), on a randomly selected area of adaxial leaf surface, avoiding prominent leaf veins. These measurements were used to calculate $F_v/F_m$ according to \citet{Genty1989}:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:fvfm}
F_v/F_m = (F_m - F_o)/F_m
\end{equation}

Where $F_m$ is the maximal fluorescence in the dark and $F_o$ is the minimal fluorescence in the dark \citep{Maxwell2000}. Fluorescence measurements were taken after exposing the seedling to 30 minutes of total darkness by covering with an opaque black bag, to ensure complete dark adaptation \citep{Campbell2007}. Dark-adapted $F_v/F_m$ measures the photosynthetic capacity of the leaf by relaxing the photo-centres prior to the fluorescence measurement. $F_v/F_m$ is preferable to other chlorophyll fluorescence measures to estimate underlying physiological stress as it removes the noise created by environmental conditions at the time of measurement, instead providing a measure of the underlying photosynthetic capacity \citep{Baker2008}. A reduction in $F_v/F_m$ is indicative of plant stress. Here, individuals with $F_v/F_m$ values \textless{}0.7 are considered to be experiencing stress \citep{Maxwell2000}. 

In addition to $F_v/F_m$, leaf chlorophyll content ($Chl_\alpha$) was measured using a multi-spectral SPAD-meter (Minolta SPAD-502Plus, Spectrum Technologies, Plainfield, Illinois, USA). To account for variation in chlorophyll content across the leaf \citep{Serrano2008}, SPAD measurements were taken at three random points on the leaf. The leaf midvein, other prominent veins, and areas of obvious leaf necrosis were avoided in these measurements. The mean of the SPAD values was used to calculate an estimate leaf chlorophyll content using the conversion factor outlined in \citet{Coste2010} for neotropical broadleaf tree species:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:chl-spad}
Chl_\alpha = 117.1 \times \frac{\overline{SPAD}}{148.84 - \overline{SPAD}}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Leaf and whole-plant morphological measurements}

After leaf physiological measurements, the same upper-most expanded leaf was removed from the seedling and hydrated for a minimum of 48 hours to reverse any leaf curling or contraction in thickness due to dessication. With the petiole removed, each leaf was photographed with a scale and the projected lead area was calculated using ImageJ Version 1.51 \citep{Schneider2012}. Mean leaf thickness was calculated using a digital micrometer (0-25 mm, Precision Technologies International, Tamworth, Staffordshire, UL) on three random points on the leaf, avoiding the midvein and prominent leaf veins. To quantify whole-seedling physiognomic characteristics we measured stem diameter below the lowest set of leaves using the digital micrometer and counted the number of fully expanded leaves (excluding cotyledons). We also measured seedling height from the base of the stem to the tip of the upper-most fully expanded leaf. Stem volume was calculated from stem width and seedling height assuming a cylinder of constant diameter \citep{}. To account for differences in seedling growth stage and to reduce the number of collinear variables in statistical analyses, stem height and number of leaves was expressed as the ratio of number of leaves per unit stem height.

\subsection{Forest canopy structural measurements}

To assess adult-seedling interactions we used two metrics, Leaf Area Index of canopy foliage, and a metric approximating the degree of crowding from surrounding adult trees. Leaf Area Index (LAI) was calculated from hemispherical photographs of the forest canopy above each seedling. Photographs were captured under uniformly overcast cloudy conditions to avoid lens flare and to aid in delineation of foliage from sky during processing \citep{Frazer2001}. Images were taken with a Coolpix 4500 compact camera, with a Nikon FC-E8 hemispherical fisheye converter lens. Images were constrained to a 60\textdegree{} circular azimuthal field of view in order to restrict LAI calculations to the part of the sky where the majority of photosynthetically active radiation penetrates the canopy \citep{Jupp2009, Jonckheere2004}. Images were then converted to 8-bit grayscale and binarized manually in ImageJ 1.51 to separate sky from plant material. Binarized images were then analyzed using \textit{Hemiphot} \citep{hemiphot} in R to estimate LAI as the projected leaf area per unit ground area (m\textsuperscript{2} m\textsuperscript{-2}).

To approximate crowding from adult trees, we used an adapted version of the Iterative Hegyi Index \citep{Hegyi1974, Lee2004, Seifert2014}. Our adapted `Iterative Seedling Index' ($ISI$) uses adult tree trunk diameter measured at \textapprox{}1.3 m from ground level (Diameter at Breast Height, DBH) and the distance of trees from the seedling to calculate an index for each seedling. Higher $ISI$ values may result from combinations of  greater adult tree DBH and adult trees being closer to the seedling, higher values indicate greater competition pressure from surrounding adult trees:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ISI}
ISI_i = log(\sum_{j=1}^n (\frac{1}{{DIST_i}_j} D_j))
\end{equation}

where $D_j$ is the DBH of a competitor tree and ${{DIST_i}_j}$ is the euclidean distance between seedling $i$ and competitor tree $j$. $ISI$ was log transformed for analysis, as results spanned multiple orders of magnitude. The `iterative' aspect refers to the selection of competitor trees. An iterative selection method for competitive trees assumes that if the path between two trees is blocked by some obstacle, \textit{e.g.} another tree, the intensity of competition between them will be greatly reduced \citep{Gadow1999}. The radius around the seedling is divided into 12 30\textdegree{} sectors, where only the nearest tree \textgreater{}10 cm DBH within each sector is measured (Figure \ref{hegyi}). The size of the Competition Radius ($C_R$) is defined as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CR}
C_R = 2 \times \sqrt{\frac{10000}{N}}
\end{equation}

where $N$ is the number of trees \textgreater10 cm DBH per ha (stand density). Stand density data was taken from ABERG census data within each plot (ABERG unpublished data) and used to interpolate the value of $C_R$ for plot VC, for which no stand density data exists. We fitted a linear regression between the elevation and trees ha\textsuperscript{-1} of each plot, and interpolated the trees ha\textsuperscript{-1} of plot VC using the regression fit (Figure \ref{comp_radius_fit}). $C_R$ was rounded to the nearest metre for ease of measurement (Table \ref{comp_radius}).

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}

A matrix of single predictor linear mixed effects models were compared to test for the presence and strength of the causal relationship between each of the two forest canopy layer structure variables and each of the six plant traits. The fixed effect of elevation was also included in this comparison in order to compare the effects of canopy layer structure to that of other unmeasured elevationally dependent environmental effects. All fixed effects were standardised and rescaled with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 to allow easy comparison of effect sizes, according to \citep{Grueber2011}. Comparison of models with different single fixed effects was performed on models fitted using Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimates \citep{Bolker2008}. Model quality was assessed using Akaike Information Criteria ($AIC$) \citep{Akaike1992}, $\delta{}AIC_r$ against a random effects model, and fixed effect marginal pseudo-R\textsuperscript{2} values ($R_M^2$) using \textit{r.squared.GLMM()} from the \textit{MuMIn} package \citep{MuMIn}. Models using different fixed effects were compared using an approximation of the variance explained by the model ($R_C^2$) using \textit{r.squared.GLMM()} \citep{MuMIn}, and slope coefficients (Figure \ref{single_pred_slope}) to compare their relative effect on plant traits. Random effects of site and species were added to the models. Site was added as a random intercept effect to account for pseudo-replication in site characteristics within which multiple seedlings per site were sampled. Tree species was added as a random slope effect to account for differences in morphology and physiology between seedlings and to allow for comparison of model slopes between species. As there were multiple species sampled within a single plot, but not all plots contained all species, these models have a partially crossed random effects structure. Single fixed effect model structures were as follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:slope_model}
\todo{Y_{ij} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X_{ij} + u_{0j} + u_{1j}X_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}}
\end{equation}

\todo{where $Y_{ij}$ is the response variable of species $i$ at site $j$, $X_{ij}$ is the fixed effect value of species $i$ in site $j$. The random intercept grouping effect of site was used in all models to account for pseudo-replication in site characteristics for seedlings sampled along the elevation gradient.}

To better understand the multiplicative effects of canopy layer structure and other elevationally dependent environmental variables on plant traits we also compared linear mixed effects models with combinations of fixed effects, using $AIC$, $W_i$ and $R_C^2$, to find the model which best explained variation in each plant trait. These models used the same basic model specification as the single fixed effect models shown above, except with multiple additive fixed effects. To ensure all models converged, these more complicated models used random intercept effects for both species and sites. For initial model comparison, these models were fitted using Maximum Likelihood. All statistical analyses were conducted using R, version 3.2.4 \citep{R2019}. Linear mixed effects models were fitted using the \textit{lme4} package \citep{Bates2015}. The best fitting models for each hysiological and physiognomic plant trait were refitted using Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) in order to assess fixed effect slopes.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Variation in plant traits across elevation}

All species except \textit{Myrcia} spp. (MS) showed a general positive trend in photosynthetic efficiency ($F_v/F_m$) across their respective elevational ranges. The spread of $F_v/F_m$ within species was small. \textit{Myrcia} spp. did not meaningfully vary over their elevational range. Random effect slopes of photosynthetic efficiency over elevation showed that none of the species level regressions dipped below the critical stress threshold of 0.7. Of the 151 measured seedlings, 12 had an $F_v/F_m$ below 0.7. Of those 12 seedlings, 4 were \textit{Alzatea verticillata} (AV), 4 were \textit{Hedyosmum goudotianum}, 2 were  \textit{Clethra revoluta} (CR) and 1 each from \textit{Clusia thurifera} (CT) and \textit{Myrcia} spp. (MS) (Figure \ref{traits_elev_slopes}). 

Chl\textsubscript{$\alpha$} generally decreased with elevation, with negative trends in \textit{A. vertitcillata} (AV), \textit{C. thurifera} (CT), \textit{Myrcia} spp. (MS), \textit{Schefflera patula} (SP) and \textit{Tapirira guianensis} (TG). \textit{C. revoluta} (CR)  and \textit{Hedyosmum goudotianum} (HG) had positive trends (Figure \ref{traits_elev_scatter}). Variation was high within species sample locations however, with the distribution of Chl\textsubscript{$\alpha$} being generally right-skewed within each species sample.

The relationship between physiognomic plant traits and elevation varied between species. Leaf:height ratio generally decreased with increasing elevation, with seedlings becoming less leafy as elevation increased, except for \textit{A. verticillata} (AV) which showed a U-shaped relationship, and \textit{H. goudotianum} (HG) which showed a hump-shaped relationship (Figure \ref{spaghetti}). Leaf area did not vary meaningfully across elevation except in \textit{S. patula} (SP) where it decreased and \textit{T. guianensis} (TG) where it increased. Leaf thickness generally increased or remained the same with elevation, except in \textit{C. thurifera} (CT), which had a weak negative relationship, with some individuals at the lower end of the elevational range having particularly thick leaves. Stem volume was similarly unaffected by elevation, except in \textit{S. patula} (SP), where it decreased with elevation and in \textit{H. goudotianum} (HG) where it increased, driven by very large seedlings at the top end of the elevation gradient.

Species with restricted elevational ranges were more likely to have steeper relationships of both physiological and physiognomic plant traits across elevation, e.g. \textit{A. verticillata} (AV), \textit{C. thurifera} (CT), \textit{S. patula} (SP) and \textit{T. guianensis} (TG). These species with restricted elevational ranges also inhabit the cloud zone of the forest elevational gradient (Figure \ref{slope_elev_scatter}).

Proxies of tree canopy structural variation did not vary significantly with elevation. LAI and ISI both showed weak negative correlations with elevation (LAI: t = -1.66(1,149), p = 0.099; ISI: t = -1.85(1,149), p = 0.066). The highest LAI values occurred near the top of the cloud forest zone at 1881 m in site TU08, however the lowest LAI values also occurred in the cloud forest zone at 1763 m in site SP1750.

Across species, models with single fixed effects poorly estimated variation in plant traits. Models with the fixed effect of elevation explained the greatest amount of variation in plant traits, notably stem volume and Chlorophyll-$\alpha$, but neither of these models were appreciably better than a random effects model including only the effects of site and species (Figure \ref{single_pred_r2m}). Models with ISI vs. stem volume and LAI vs. leaf thickness were the only two single fixed effect models using canopy structure variables which provided adequate model fit, estimated via $\delta{}AIC_r$, slope coefficients and $R^2_m$ (Figure \ref{single_pred_r2m}). ISI caused a decrease in stem volume, LAI caused a decrease in leaf thickness.

Table \ref{best_mod_multi_output} shows the fixed effects and model fit measures from the best fitting multiple fixed effect models used to predict plant traits. All of the best multiple predictor mixed effects models included elevation as a fixed effect. All of the best models, except the model predicting leaf Chl\textsubscript{$\alpha$}, included both adult canopy structure variables, ISI and LAI, alongside that of elevation (Figure \ref{multi_pred_slope}). The variance explained by these best multiple predictor mixed effects models was higher than that for the single fixed effects models but the variance accounted for by the fixed effects remained low, the highest being for stem volume, with an $R^2_m$ of 0.23. $F_v/F_m$, Leaf:height ratio, Stem volume and Leaf thickness had models which were better than a random effects model with $\delta{}AIC_r > 2$. In the best fitting multiple fixed effect model for $F_v/F_m$, ISI and LAI had contrasting effects. An increase in ISI led to a decrease in $F_v/F_m$ while an increase in LAI led to an increase in $F_v/F_m$.

\section*{Discussion}

This study aimed to: (a) determine whether tree seedling physiological and physiognomic plant traits were affected by tree canopy structure across an elevation gradient, (b) assess how the effects of canopy structure compared to that of elevation, and (c) assess the degree to which plant trait-elevation relationships vary among species. It was found that (a) forest canopy structure variables did not influence a given plant trait more than elevation, but that (b) combinations of elevation and canopy structure variables predict variation in plant traits marginally better than elevation alone. Canopy structure variables were not correlated with elevation, and instead reflected variation in habitat, with forest canopy structure becoming highly spatially variable within the cloud forest zone. Tree species with more restricted elevational ranges, which inhabit the cloud zone of the elevational gradient were more sensitive to variation in canopy structural factors (c). Interestingly however, according to $F_v/F_m$ chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, seedlings did not experience greater physiological stress at higher elevations.

\subsection{Photosynthetic efficiency - $F_v/F_m$ and Chl\textsubscript{$\alpha$}}

Estimates of photosynthetic efficiency using $F_v/F_m$ and leaf Chl\textsubscript{$\alpha$} concentration suggest that seedlings are not stressed at any point along their current elevational range, and thus are acclimating to their environment. Seedlings had lower $F_v/F_m$ at the base of their elevational ranges. This suggests that if climate warming were to continue seedling mortality may occur at the base of the species elevational range, but that further upslope migration is not limited. Species with restricted elevational ranges (e.g. AV, CT, SP, and TG), found in the cloud zone \textapprox{}1500-1800 m had steeper relationships of $F_v/F_m$ and elevation, which suggests that these species may be the most vulnerable to continued warming. This raises concerns for the cloud forest zone as a unique ecosystem, as species turnover is high within this zone, with high biodiversity across multiple taxonomic groups \citep{Ledo2012}. Continued warming may lead to a reduction of cloud forest specialist tree species, which instead may be replaced by generalist lowland species which have a competitive advantage at the top end of their elevational range \citep{Valladares2008, Nicotra2010}. In a review by \citet{Herzog2011}, it is concluded that the environmentally suitable area for cloud forest in the Andes will decline rapidly over the next century due mainly to anthropogenic climate change which is causing the cloud base to shift quickly.


It was predicted that seedlings at the upper limits of their elevational range would have lower photosynthetic efficiency due to increased exposure to damaging UV-B rays, however this was not observed. As we located existing seedlings in their natural habitat, which presumably were located in suitably shaded areas in order that they avoid UV-B damage, we may not have encountered individuals at the very extremes of their habitat tolerance. Certainly, above-seedling LAI measurements and ISI values only decreased marginally over the entire elevational transect (Figure \ref{comp_elev}). Therefore, upslope migration of seedlings may not be limited by existing forest canopy effects, due to adequate spatial heterogeneity of canopy structure.

Mixed effects models with multiple fixed effects used to predict variation in $F_v/F_m$ were of better quality when forest canopy structure variables were included, though this increase in model fit was small and so H\textsubscript{3} should not be accepted unequivocally. As elevation and the forest canopy structure variables were not correlated, this implies that predictions of seedling stress can be improved by adding measurements tree canopy layer structural properties to models in addition to elevationally dependent abiotic environmental factors. 

Data on tree canopy layer structure was collected laboriously by hand for this study. Given the relatively minor increase in model fit, it may not be practical to include canopy layer structural properties in larger scale models predicting elevational range shifts. In some cases though, for example when predicting changes within the highly sensitive and inherently valuable cloud forest ecosystem, it may be desirable. There is also promise that canopy structural data could be collected using remote sensing methods to reduce labour in data collection while achieving a more representative estimate of forest structural properties at the landscape scale \citep{Messinger2016, Palace2015}.

\subsection{Plant trait response to elevation}

\todo{intro, variation in physiognomy denotes acclimation}

Tree species varied in seedling physiognomic acclimatory responses to elevation. As with photosynthetic efficiency measurements, species with narrow elevational ranges were more sensitive to elevational variation. \textit{S. patula} (SP) grew smaller leaves and smaller stems with increasing elevation. This can be interpreted as a conservative response to increasingly stressful environmental conditions at higher elevations. Similarly, the succulent leaved \textit{C. thurifera} had thinner leaves at higher elevations, possibly a conservative or stress response to higher elevations. As the standard error of the model slope was large however, the apparent trend may have been driven by a few seedlings with particularly thick leaves, possibly as a result of high soil moisture content (Figure \ref{box}). \todo{\textit{C. thurifera} is a succulent}.

\subsection{Species rarity, specialists and generalists}

Nine tree species were selected for this study. Although these species are common in the areas we sampled (Appendix VI), there are many other species which may react more or less to the biotic environment. There is evidence that rare species (small population) are more sensitive to variation in environmental factors, \citep{Lyons2005,Mouillot2013}. Rare species are more likely to occupy specialist niches, which occur over a narrower geographic range than those of generalist species \citep{Boulangeat2012}. The evolutionary histories of specialists means they are less likely to be able to acclimate to novel environments \citep{}. Compared to the common species studied here, rare species will not have such a large direct effect on globally significant ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, albedo, and drainage. This does not mean however, that rare species do not have the potential to heavily influence ecosystem services indirectly. \citet{Lyons2001}, and \citet{Lyons2005} found that less common species play vital supporting roles in maintaining ecosystem functions such as enhancing invasion resistance and making limiting resources available to other species.

\subsection{Future studies}

This study is deliberately wide in its scope, using proxies for forest canopy structure in order to infer the influences of multiple ecosystem processes such as nutrient competition, and shading. By not explicitly testing the effects of these mechanistic processes, which are complex in their effects, we cannot determine the relative contribution of each process implicit in the measured proxies. It is recommended therefore that experiments under constant environmental conditions explicitly test the effect of variation in specific ecosystem processes such as shading and nutrient availability. Understanding the specific mechanisms which drive the trends seen in this study will help to identify elevation dependent thresholds which may act as a barrier to seedling growth in the future under continued elevational range shifts.

Here, we focussed on tree seedlings as a key demographic bottleneck for tree survival, however, continued climate change over the long term may also lead to changes in the survival of existing adult trees, with further consequences for ecosystem structure and function. One of the key limiting factor for large tropical forest trees is water availability. In the Central Andes, precipitation is predicted to reduce by \textapprox{}15\% by 2100 \citep{Lewis2011}. In order to determine whether changes in elevation dependent environmental variables also affect adult trees along our elevational gradient, similar studies to ours could be performed on adult trees. Seed production of adult trees in the tropics is often reduced under stress conditions \citep{Klimas2012, Muller-Landau2010}. By understanding how climate change affects seed production the accuracy of local species range-shift models could be improved by adding spatially explicit demographic terms.
